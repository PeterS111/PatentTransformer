A second memory of a second type in the general purpose cache that stores a second number of instructions in response to an instruction cache miss in the instruction cache. A first counter of a first type in the general purpose cache is set to a first value in response to a microinstruction cache miss in the instruction cache. A second counter of a second type in the general purpose cache and a second counter of the first type are set to a same second value, when a microinstruction cache miss is detected in the instruction cache. A third counter of the second type is set to a first value in response to an instruction cache write to the instruction cache. When a microinstruction of a write instruction is detected when the third counter of the second type is set to the first value, the main CPU receives a signal indicating that a microinstruction is to be written. A second counter of the first type is set to a second value, when a microprogram (or a microinstructions) is to be written. The main CPU uses the third counter to address a portion of the second address space in the general purpose cache so as to retrieve the associated data from the general purpose cache.

Non-contact laser temperature optimization process for an optical disk system having laser power control

[ title --> abstract ]
The temperature uniformity of an optical disk drive during operation is maintained at a desired value by employing a power control system for maintaining the laser level output of the laser. The disk drive employs a thermal lens to focus the laser pulse on the substrate. The power control employs a thermocouple which is responsive to changes in the laser temperature and provides a feedback signal to a thermocouple controller based upon such changes. A digital to analog converter receives the thermocouple feedback signal and provides a corresponding analog voltage to a variable gain amplifier which adjusts the voltage to the thermal lens. The thermocouple comprises a thermocouple and temperature sensing circuit, which monitors temperature changes and produces a voltage proportional to the temperature changes. The digital to analog converter includes an amplifier having an input for receiving the voltage and an output which is coupled to the input of the thermocouple. The output of the digital to analog converter is coupled to an analog to digital converter which converts the voltage output of the thermocouple into a digital signal in a digital to analog relationship. The output of the temperature sensing circuit, in turn, is coupled to a logic unit which provides an output signal to the laser power controller. The logic unit receives the output signal and generates a variable signal which represents the temperature and the heat energy level to the thermal lens. In this manner, the optical disk drive may be operated at more than three different operating temperatures.
