(abstract)
A method and system is provided for maintaining customer data in a data store system utilizing a scalable partitioning framework. More specifically, the data store of a customer service system is partitioned (divided) into multiple partitions by a partitionable key of customer data so that each partition owns a subset of the customer data. By maintaining several partitions that store a subset of the customer data exclusive to each other, blackout or brownout problems can be local to one partition and, thus, the availability for the entire system will be increased. Moreover, a set of partitionable keys, a minimal unit to be moved between partitions, is grouped and associated with a partition. By eliminating direct dependencies between the partitions and the partitionable keys, the system can have great flexibility with regard to migrating customer data between partitions and adding a new partition.

The post anvil is allowed to move up and down in relation to the driver, but its movement is limited by both lower and upper fixed barriers. Since the movement is limited, the operator can position the driver upon the post allowing the full weight of the driver framework/carrier machine to rest upon the post. The post would push the floating post anvil upward only to the point at which the upper fixed barrier prevents further upward movement of the floating post anvil. Thus, once the floating post anvil abuts the upper fixed barrier, substantially the entire weight of the post driver is resting on the post.

The SPP factor, which has a value typically ranging between zero and one, is modified or warped responsive to a value obtained from the evaluation of a sigmoid function, the shape of which is determined by a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is obtained by an evaluation of the signal energy and noise energy output from a microphone over time. The shape and aggressiveness of the sigmoid function is determined using an extrinsically-determined SNR, not determined by the MMSE determination.

(abstract)
The present invention provides a method for preparing carbon nanotube fibers with improved spinning properties using a surfactant and carbon nanotube fibers prepared by the method. According to the method for preparing carbon nanotube fibers of the present invention, the addition of a surfactant during the preparation of carbon nanotubes interrupts and delays the agglomeration of catalyst particles, which reduces the size of the catalyst particles and uniformly disperses the catalyst particles that play a key role in the formation of carbon nanotube fibers, thus increasing the strength and conductivity of carbon nanotube fibers and improving the spinning properties. While convention methods prepare carbon nanotube fibers by injecting a catalytic material for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes in a high-pressure supercritical state to be uniformly dispersed, the present invention uses a dispersant and thus does not require the injection in a high-pressure supercritical state.

(abstract)
A system which includes a turbo bypass switching valve (BSV) positioned at a beneficial location as a direct mount on an air box to achieve compliance to OBD hose-off requirement via electronic actuation of the BSV and monitoring of the fuel tank pressure sensor for pressure change. When the turbocharger unit is generating pressurized air, the turbo BSV is open, and vapor is passing through the purge valve, some level of vacuum in the fuel tank is sensed. By closing the BSV, flow through the venturi is reduced, producing both less vacuum and a change in fuel tank pressure. The pressure change does not occur if any of the hoses become disconnected. This results in a simple OBD &#x201c;venture hose off&#x201d; check without additional components.

(abstract)
A method and system for processing network metadata is described. Network metadata may be processed by dynamically instantiated executable software modules which make policy-based decisions about the character of the network metadata and about presentation of the network metadata to consumers of the information carried by the network metadata. The network metadata may be type classified and each subclass within a type may be mapped to a definition by a unique fingerprint value. The fingerprint value may be used for matching the network metadata subclasses against relevant policies and transformation rules. For template-based network metadata such as NetFlow v9, an embodiment of the invention can constantly monitor network traffic for unknown templates, capture template definitions, and informs administrators about templates for which custom policies and conversion rules do not exist. Conversion modules can efficiently convert selected types and/or subclasses of network metadata into alternative metadata formats.

A data processing application uses a translation file to render a visual surface based on underlying structured data. The data processing application provides mapping between nodes associated with the visual surface and nodes associated with the structured data. The mapping is generated in two phases. In a first phase, the data processing application adds mapping functions to the translation file. In the second phase, the data processing application renders the visual surface on the basis of a specific instance of the structured data, and, in the process, executes the mapping functions within the translation file to provide specific pointer information that is embedded amongst the nodes associated with the visual surface. The pointer information points back to specific locations in the structured data, thus providing mapping between the visual surface and the structured data. The structured data can be formed using Extensible Markup Language (XML). The visual surface can be formed using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The translation file can be formed using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).

A base layer and one or more enhancement layers may be used to carry video signals, wherein the base layer cannot be decoded and viewed on its own. Lower bit depth input image data to base layer processing may be generated from higher bit depth high dynamic range input image data via advanced quantization to minimize the volume of image data to be carried by enhancement layer video signals.

(actual claim) A method of arbitrating for access to an interconnect, comprising: <|span|> receiving, over time, one or more data transfer requests, each indicating an input port from n input ports, and <|span|> an output port of m output ports in an interconnect, through which the request will be serviced; <|span|> buffering each of the requests; <|span|> assigning a respective empty arbitration packet to a respective picker assigned to each of the input ports, each arbitration packet having a location for each of the m output ports; <|span|> at each of the pickers, selecting at least one buffered request and placing each selected request in the arbitration packet at said each picker in the location for the output port indicated by the selected request; <|span|> passing the arbitration packets among the pickers until each picker has received each arbitration packet, and <|span|> while each picker has each arbitration packet, attempting to place at least one request in any remaining location in that arbitration packet; and <|span|> scheduling fulfillment of the requests using the interconnect according to the placement of the requests in the arbitration packets.
(abstract)
Aspects relate to arbitrating access to an interconnect among multiple ports. For example, input ports receive requests for access to identified destination ports and buffer these in one or more FIFOs. A picker associated with respective FIFO(s) begins an empty arbitration packet that includes a location for each output port and fills one or more locations in the packet, such as based on a prioritization scheme. Each packet is passed in a ring to another picker, which performs a fill that does not conflict with previously filled locations in that packet. Each picker has an opportunity to place requests in each of the packets. Results of the arbitration are dispatched to reorder buffers associated with respective output ports and used to schedule the interconnect. Each arbitration cycle thus produces a set of control information for an interconnect to be used in subsequent data transfer steps.
