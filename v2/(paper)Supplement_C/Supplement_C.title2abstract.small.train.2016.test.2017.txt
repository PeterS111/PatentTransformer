(predicted abstract) A computer-implemented method, system, and computer program product for implementing a virtual machine snapshot. The method comprises, for a computer system comprising a processing system comprising a memory and at least one processor, detecting a virtual machine. The virtual machine comprises a first state, a second state, a first set of states being a state of the virtual machine in which all states are kept, and a second set of states being a state of the virtual machine in which at least one state is maintained. A first snapshot of the virtual machine is stored in a first storage system remote from the system. A second snapshot of the virtual machine is stored in a second storage system remote from the system. The first snapshot and the second snapshot are linked in the memory of the processing system. The method further comprises generating a third snapshot by copying the second snapshot from the memory to the first storage system in response to detecting that the second state is maintained.
(actual abstract) Techniques are described herein which minimize the impact of virtual machine snapshots on the performance virtual machines and hypervisors. In the context of a volume snapshot which may involve (i) taking virtual machine snapshots of all virtual machines associated with the volume, (ii) taking the volume snapshot, and (iii) removing all the virtual machine snapshots, the virtual machine snapshots may be created in a first order and removed in a second order. Specifically, snapshots for busy virtual machines (i.e., virtual machines with higher disk write activity) may be created last and removed first. Consequently, snapshots of busy virtual machines are retained for shorter periods of time, thereby minimizing the effect of virtual machine snapshots on those virtual machines (and their associated hypervisors) that would be most negatively impacted by virtual machine snapshots.

(actual abstract) A wellbore cementing tool configured for placement in a wellbore or in a drill string, and method of using same. The tool comprises a body having upper and lower members connected by a shear component. A rod is connected to the upper member, and the tool can be lowered with the rod into the wellbore or drill string to a desired depth. At the desired depth, locking means are deployed to lock the tool in position, the tool is sealed, and cement can be injected through the tool to the annulus of the outer casing. In some embodiments the tool is locked using a pushing motion that extends locking members outwardly from the tool to engage the wellbore walls or the inner surfaces of the drill string. Once cementing is completed, the rod is pulled from surface thereby causing the shear component to rupture and the upper and lower members to disconnect, and the upper member can be drawn to surface leaving the rest of the tool downhole. The tool does not require rotation to recover the rod, hence reducing the risk of loosening the threaded connections of lengths of drill pipe.

(actual abstract) Reframing is used to re-size an image or video content, e.g. for displaying video signals with a given aspect ratio on a display having a different aspect ratio. Window cropping parameters (position and size over time) are constrained in order to optimise the rate/distortion of the encoded output video signal. Initial reframing is improved by computing a saliency map representing a user attention map which considers the video coding context and by providing a macroblock coding efficiency cost map and then taking the saliency map or a combined saliency/coding cost map into account so that the coding cost for said reframed video signal is smaller than the coding cost for other candidate reframing windows' sizes and positions.

(predicted abstract) A system and method for determining a collision risk in a vehicle are disclosed. For a first time interval, a first state of collision of the vehicle is determined over a prior time interval. For a second time interval, a second state of collision of the vehicle is determined over the prior time interval. A collision risk is generated and the collision risk is reported to a user. The collision risk may be based on relative humidity and air temperature at the subsequent time interval, or a ratio of relative humidity and air temperature at the prior time interval. A third state of collision of the vehicle is determined. A collision risk is generated that meets a predetermined risk criterion based on the first and second states. The collision risk of the vehicle is reported to the user when the collision risk meets predetermined predetermined threshold, and at least one system of the vehicle is selected for delivery after another predetermined threshold as a consequence of the user receiving another collision risk.
(actual abstract) The disclosure is related to a system and a method for collision avoidance for vehicle. In the method, the system predicts multiple routes of an abnormal vehicle in a period of time according to historical data when a nearby vehicle receives an alert from the abnormal vehicle. A route potential pattern can be created when the system gets the historical data. The system also computes one or more available routes for the nearby vehicle based on its vehicle information. Every available route has its collision risk value. The system finally provides a recommended route with lower collision risk value when it considers a time of the abnormal vehicle reaches its great change, a time of predicting the nearby vehicle meets the range of route potential pattern, and a safe distance there-between.

(actual abstract) A new framework for video compressed sensing models the evolution of the image frames of a video sequence as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, from which the image frames are then reconstructed. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably yet obtain video recovery at a high frame rate that is in fact inversely proportional to the length of the video sequence. This property makes our framework well-suited for high-speed video capture and other applications. We validate our approach with a range of experiments including classification experiments that highlight the purposive nature of our framework.

(predicted abstract) The present invention relates to a photonic bandgap fiber and a fiber laser device using same. The fiber is used for obtaining high power and high power light intensity through use of photonic bandgap fiber. The fiber comprises first and second light-diffusing surfaces, and a plurality of grooves are provided in the first and second surfaces respectively. The plurality of grooves are formed in a surface of the fiber having a depth that is less than a wavelength when the fiber is used for obtaining the high power and high power light intensity. Thus, it is possible to obtain the wide beam from the respective single grooves and narrow the corresponding multi-mode light intensity toward one or two diffusing surfaces and thus to obtain a wide bandgap fiber that is more uniform than that of a wide color filter and can obtain the narrow bandgap light at the same wavelength.
(actual abstract) There is provided a photonic bandgap fiber used in a state in which at least a part of the photonic bandgap fiber is bent at radii of 15 cm or greater and 25 cm or less. A large number of high refractive index portions <b>57</b> are disposed in a nineteen-cell core type in three layers, and a V value is 1.5 or greater and 1.63 or less. In the high refractive index portions <b>57</b>, conditions are defined that a relative refractive index difference is &#x394;% and a lattice constant is &#x39b; &#x3bc;m so as to remove light in a higher mode at the bent portion as described above.

(actual abstract) The present disclosure generally comprises a heated showerhead assembly that may be used to supply processing gases into a processing chamber. The processing chamber may be an etching chamber. When processing gas is evacuated from the processing chamber, the uniform processing of the substrate may be difficult. As the processing gas is pulled away from the substrate and towards the vacuum pump, the plasma, in the case of etching, may not be uniform across the substrate. Uneven plasma may lead to uneven etching. To prevent uneven etching, the showerhead assembly may be separated into two zones each having independently controllable gas introduction and temperature control. The first zone corresponds to the perimeter of the substrate while the second zone corresponds to the center of the substrate. By independently controlling the temperature and the gas flow through the showerhead zones, etching uniformity of the substrate may be increased.

(predicted abstract) According to one embodiment, a method for reducing power losses and state-offshreperferential-controlled switches of a power converter includes determining power loss by comparing a voltage across an inductor of the power converter to a target load voltage. A switch controller of the power converter receives a first control signal and a comparison value, where the comparison value is representative of the difference between the voltage across the inductor and the target load voltage. When the comparison value is equal to or above a preset threshold value, the switch controller will reduce the current provided to a load of the power converter through a current limiting element. When the comparison value exceeds the preset threshold value, the switch controller will return the current from the inductor to a lower state.
(actual abstract) A simulator for a switched electronic power converter circuit feeding a load/device uses a modified FAMNM solver. Provided is a method/system for reducing/eliminating spurious power losses and transients inherently caused by the FAMNM solver using an L/C element approach, wherein a switching device in the &#x2018;on&#x2019; state is featured as an inductor L, and a switching device that is in the &#x2018;off&#x2019; state is featured as either a capacitance C or series-connected resistance and capacitance R-C. The invention uses cross-initialization of the L/C switching elements to their final state of current and voltage when they change their conduction state. The correct cross-initialization is enabled from optional pre-stored tables of events and the system-states at the time of the cross-initialization. The inventive method is an enhancement over known Dommel and Pejovic type FAMNM solvers. The simulator applies to real-time or non-real time simulators and is suitable for all power converter topologies.

(actual abstract) The present invention is a robotic system for maintaining product inventory and dispensing products upon request from a customer or other user. Product items are stored in an inventory storage unit (ISU), one item per bin. Controller logic allows items to be stored in, and retrieved from, arbitrarily-assigned storage locations. The bins hang on rails within drawers. In a replenishment operation, the system transfers empty bins to an operator station for replenishment. An operator fills the empty bins with product items. The system inserts these bins into drawers in the ISU. In a purge operation, the operator enters an identifier of a class of product to be removed. The system moves the bins containing the affected items to the operator station. After the product items are removed, the empty bins are moved to the ISU.

(actual abstract) When compiling high-level, graphical code (e.g. LabVIEW&#x2122; code) to a different representation (e.g. different software code or hardware FPGA), information relating to characteristics of the design may be collected/captured from the compilation process, and automatically provided to all the earlier stages of the compilation process to obtain more optimal results. Without automated feedback of this information, users have to manually identify, produce, and provide the feedback information, or forego the process altogether, having to assume that the tool has produced the best possible results when that may not be the case. To correct timing, failed constraints paths may be parsed and compared to delays obtained during a previous compile, and previous adjustments that didn't yield desired results may be undone. The longest delay that didn't result from an undone path may then be identified, and adjusted, and the process may be repeated until all paths are predicted to pass.

The shaft may include a shaft hole for the armature to slide. The armature may include a coil-retaining portion provided in at least one longitudinal end of the armature and configured to retain an electric wire and a contact portion at which the coil spring is held. The slider may be provided in the guide groove to engage the coil-retaining portion and release the coil spring to displace the armature between a normal state and a depressed state. The coil spring may include: a plurality of coils disposed in a coil spring supporting portion and configured to form an annular shape about the shaft hole and between the armature and the guide groove; a first portion configured to hold the coil spring in the depressed state; and a second portion configured to extend between an upper portion of the armature and the guide groove when the armature is located at the normal state.
(actual abstract) Embodiments described herein may take the form of an electromagnetic actuator that produces a haptic output during operation. Generally, an electromagnetic coil is wrapped around a central magnet array. A shaft passes through the central magnet array, such that the central array may move along the shaft when the proper force is applied. When a current passes through the electromagnetic coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. The coil is stationary with respect to a housing of the actuator, while the central magnet array may move along the shaft within the housing. Thus, excitation of the coil exerts a force on the central magnet array, which moves in response to that force. The direction of the current through the coil determines the direction of the magnetic field and thus the motion of the central magnet array.
