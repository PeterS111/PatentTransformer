(predicted title) Apparatus and method for monitoring the presence of transponders using wide band frequency signals
(actual title) Method, apparatus and article for detection of transponder tagged objects, for example during surgery
(abstract)
The presence or absence of objects is determined by interrogating or exciting transponders coupled to the objects using pulsed wide band frequency signals. Interrogation is broken down into a number of subsample scan cycles each having interrogation cycles a start time forward in time by a fraction of a period of an expected transponder response signal. Ambient or background noise is evaluated and a threshold adjusted based on the level of noise. Adjustment may be based on multiple noise measurements or samples. Noise detection may be limited, with emphasis placed on interrogation to increase the signal to noise ratio. Matched filtering may be employed. Presence/absence determination may take into account frequency and/or Q value to limit false detections. Appropriate acts may be taken if detected noise is out of defined limits of operation, for example shutting down interrogation and/or providing an appropriate indication.

When the output voltage is not within the acceptable operational range and the operational frequency is below a maximum predetermined frequency, the operational frequency of the LLC resonant converter circuit is adjusted. The adjustment of the operational frequency is effective to change the output voltage to a value that is within the acceptable operational range. When the output voltage is not within the acceptable operational range and the operational frequency is above the maximum predetermined frequency, a phase shift in the LLC resonant converter circuit is adjusted. This adjustment is effective to change the output voltage to a value that is within the acceptable operational range.

(abstract)
One or more techniques and/or systems are provided for regulating an amount of power on a power grid using a datacenter. This allows demand to be more closely brought into alignment with supply. For example, when supply exceeds demand by a predetermined level, the datacenter may increase consumption, causing demand to increase, and when demand exceeds supply and/or comes within a predetermined threshold of supply, the datacenter may decrease consumption, causing demand to decrease. In this way, the datacenter can be utilized as a regulatory tool on the grid. It may be appreciated that given the technology used by and/or operations performed by datacenters, datacenters are uniquely situated to achieve these ends as compared to other (large) energy consumers, such as manufacturing facilities that cannot shift around and/or shut-down operations swiftly.

An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure illustrates a duty cycle correction apparatus for fast adjusting internal clocks to have specific duty cycles. Firstly, a reference clock is adjusted to have one specific duty cycle in response to analog feedback clocks. Then, by using a phase detector, phases of the reference clock and one internal clock are compared to generate a phase detection signal. Next, by using a digital-analog converter, complementary signals are generated according to a phase detection signal received by the counter, and the signals are used to adjust the duty cycles of the internal clocks. When the complementary signals make the duty cycle of the internal clock equals to the specific duty cycle, codes of the complementary signals are recorded.

(abstract)
This invention is related to a pharmaceutical combination that contains a Casein kinase 2 (CK2) peptide inhibitor (termed P15) along with the standard chemotherapeutic drugs used in cancer treatment and which are administered together, separated or sequentially. The chemothearapeutic drugs include cisplatin, taxol, alkaloids from Vinca, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, mitomycin C, imatinib, iressa and velcade (bortezomib). The synergism between the P15 peptide and the anticancer drugs achieves an efficient concentration of each cytostatic drug in the combination which is from 10- to 100-fold lower than that for each cytostatic drug alone. The pharmaceutical combination described in this invention exhibits lower toxicity compared to that reported by the anticancer therapeutics and therefore, it represents a crucial advantage for its use in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the sequential administration of this pharmaceutical combination through the pretreatment with the P15 peptide leads to the chemo sensibilization of refractory tumors to the anticancer therapeutics.

(abstract)
A system generates a simplified model from an original model, where the simplified model exhibits the same error or undesired behavior as the original model but is smaller. A condition may be defined that, when evaluated, may determine whether the error or undesired behavior occurs in a model. A search engine may identify one or more portions of the original model as candidates for deletion. A series of intermediate models of decreasing size may be constructed by deleting selected ones of the candidate portions, provided that the intermediate models also produce the same error or undesired behavior. The system may continue an iterative process until it resolves to the simplified model, and the simplified model may be analyzed to locate the source or cause of the error or undesired behavior.

(actual title) Context based virtual area creation
(abstract)
Examples of systems and methods for context based virtual area creation are described. Some examples provide a quick and easy way for users to wrap virtual areas around contexts of interest. Examples of such contexts may be defined in terms of one or more of content, people, and real-world location. The virtual areas support realtime communications between communicants (e.g., one or more of text chat, voice, video, application sharing, and file sharing) and provide a persistent historical repository for interactions in the virtual area. Summaries of activities and other events in virtual areas typically are published in realtime so that other communicants can readily obtain a quick summary of the activities occurring in a particular context and decide whether or not to join or otherwise participate in those activities.

(predicted title) System for accessing and using information in a memory area
(actual title) Gate system for inventory control and theft prevention
(abstract)
The present invention relates to a gate system which uses overlapping radiation patterns to deduce when an item is entering a warehouse and when an item is leaving a warehouse, for example, for loading onto a truck. The present invention stores information relating to the direction the item moved and actuates an alarm if the item is moved in an unexpected direction. The radiation patterns of the gates are angled such that one radiation pattern from a first antenna is directed towards the loading dock, while another radiation pattern from a second antenna is directed towards the interior of the building. Overlapping the radiation patterns allows the logic circuitry to account for the item as it moves from one side of the gate system to the other.

(abstract)
A system, method, and computer program product for generating a regulated boosted load voltage. A comparator may use reduced versions of a reference voltage, a supply voltage, and a fed-back output load voltage to determine whether the output load voltage requires adjustment. If so, a controller may responsively vary the number of voltage boosting charge pumps connected in parallel to the load to best match a target voltage. The target voltage may be the reference voltage plus the supply voltage. A counter may track the number of active charge pumps, and may increment or decrement the number more slowly than the charge pumps operate. Loop gain may be limited by an integrating filter to prevent oscillation. The embodiments are of particular utility for signal conversion circuitry as they eliminate difficulties arising from gate-source voltage inadequacies and differences in switch transistors. A wider range of reference voltages may be accommodated.

The vapor is introduced to a brine which is adapted to exothermically absorb one or more components therefrom, and heat is withdrawn, to produce at least a flow of heat and a flow of brine which is enriched in the one or more components. The heat previously withdrawn is transferred, to drive the vaporization. This transfer can be associated with the change of a working fluid from a gaseous into a liquid state. In this case, the heat withdrawal involves the change of the working fluid from the liquid to the gaseous state. In the liquid state, the working fluid flows only by one or more of gravity, convection and wicking. In the gaseous state, the working fluid flows only by one or more of diffusion and convection.

(predicted title) Data- asset-level fingerprint mapping for data stored in a computer memory
(actual title) Object-level identification of duplicate data in a storage system
(abstract)
The technique introduced here includes a system and method for identification of duplicate data directly at a data-object level. The technique illustratively utilizes a hierarchical tree of fingerprints for each data object to compare data objects and identify duplicate data blocks referenced by the data objects. The hierarchical fingerprint trees are constructed in such a manner that a top-level fingerprint (or object-level fingerprint) of the hierarchical tree is representative of all data blocks referenced by a storage system. In embodiments, inline techniques are utilized to generate hierarchical fingerprints for new data objects as they are created, and an object-level fingerprint of the new data object is compared against preexisting object-level fingerprints in the storage system to identify exact or close matches. While exact matches result in complete deduplication of data blocks referenced by the data object, hierarchical comparison methods are used for identifying and mapping duplicate data blocks referenced by closely related data objects.

(predicted title) Surface reconstruction based on deforming volume regions
(actual title) Using free-form deformations in surface reconstruction
(abstract)
Volumes of a 3D physical space are used in a surface reconstruction process, where adjacent volumes share vertices so that no gaps or overlaps between the volumes exist. As a result, a continuous surface is obtained in the surface reconstruction process. The vertices are anchored to nodes in a pose graph, such that locations of the vertices are adjusted as the pose graph is updated. As a result, a deformation of the volumes is permitted. Based on the deformation of a volume, a region of a depth map of the physical space is deformed correspondingly. Each vertex can be anchored to a closest node of the pose graph, or to a point which is based on a combination of nodes. In one approach, the point is defined based on the closest node and other nodes within a defined radius of the closest node.

In another embodiment, an aqueous food comprising bioactive components is mixed with the prolamin solution, thereby initiating precipitation of the prolamin and concentration of the bioactive components in said aqueous food. Resulting powdered forms of encapsulated flavor comprise the bioactive components from the aqueous food. In another embodiment, a two-phase drying process may be employed comprising removal of alcohol for evaporation-induced-self-assembly of zein microstructures, followed by removal of remaining water to produce said powdered form.

(predicted title) Method of depositing metals between two wires while preventing oxidation
(actual title) Gas tungsten arc welding with cross AC arcing twin wires
(abstract)
Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is a widely used process for joining metals. Its main advantage over its competition gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is its high productivity in depositing metals. However, to melt metal from the wire to deposit into the work-piece, additional heat is consumed and applied to the work-piece with an uncontrolled fixed proportion to the effective heat that melts the wire. Such additional heat is often in excess of the needed heat input for the work-piece. The side-effects include a waste of the energy, an increased distortion, and possible materials property degradation. This invention is to device a method to transfer this part of heat to melt the wire by adding two wires, which form a pair of arc spots, under a tungsten arc. It also devices a method to assure the arc between the two wires be maintained stable such that the transfer be successfully continuous. The successful continuous transfer improves the energy efficiency, eliminates the adverse effects on the distortion and materials property, and decouples the controls on mass input and heat input on the work-piece.

(actual title) Media and drive validation in a storage library
(abstract)
Systems and methods are described for validating storage media and/or media drives in a storage library using a hidden drive pool and a non-hidden media pool. For example, a storage library can be instructed to perform media/drive validation (MDV) on a selected pool of physical storage media using a selected pool of drive resources. Embodiments handle the pools so that, at least during performance of MDV, the drive resources in the drive pool are not visible to the host applications, but the storage media is still visible and can still be accessed by the host application. For example, the MDV can be performed in such a way that the host application cannot task a drive being used for validation, but the host application can perform operations on storage media in the media validation pool. Further, some embodiments operate in the context of storage library complex-wide validation pools.

An airbag of a side airbag apparatus includes an upstream inflation portion, which inflates by inflation gas, and deploys frontward at a side of a vehicle seat. An opening is provided at a wall portion of the upstream inflation portion. A pressure regulator valve closes before an occupant is restrained by the upstream inflation portion, thereby restricting the inflation gas in the upstream inflation portion from flowing through the opening. Upon the occupant restraint, the pressure regulator valve cancels the restriction in response to a change in a tensed state of the dividing portion by an external force applied due to the restraint. A tear seam that connects valve body portions of the pressure regulator valve delays the opening time of the pressure regulator valve upon the occupant restraint by the upstream inflation portion relative to the opening time set only by the pressure regulator valve.

(abstract)
A system and method for reproducing audio sound. Audio sound, based on an audio signal, is emitted within a space comprising an audio beamwidth. Modulated ultrasonic sound energy based on a modulated ultrasonic sound signal is emitted in an ultrasonic sound direction within an ultrasonic beamwidth that is less than and within the audio beamwidth. The modulated ultrasonic sound signal is generated such that the emitted modulated ultrasonic sound energy creates an audible cancellation sound with an amplitude substantially equal to an amplitude of the audio sound at a point within the ultrasonic beamwidth so as to combine with and cancel the audio sound at the point by being substantially out of phase with the audio sound along the ultrasonic sound direction.

(predicted title) Control circuit with false sampling prevention
(actual title) On time sampling prevention
(abstract)
An example controller circuit includes a feedback sampling circuit, an oscillator, a drive logic, and a false sampling prevention circuit. The feedback sampling circuit generates a sample signal in response to a sampling of a feedback signal. The oscillator generates an on-time signal that transitions from a first logic state to a second logic state during each period of the on-time signal. The drive logic controls a switch to regulate the output of a power converter. The drive logic turns on the switch to end an off-time of the switch in response to the on-time signal transitioning from the first logic state to the second logic state. The false sampling prevention circuit prevents the on-time signal from transitioning from the first logic state to the second logic state to extend the off-time of the switch until a sampling complete signal indicates that sampling of the feedback signal is complete.

(actual title) Low latency authentication of gated media relay services
(abstract)
Media relay services are often used to establish sufficiently direct connections in order to enable provisioning of a real-time media service and/or improve the quality of real-time media services. However, media relay services are often gated using authentication systems that add undesirable delay to the delivery and/or access to a real-time media service, which in turn diminish the user experience. By contrast, various implementations disclosed herein include apparatuses, systems, and methods of providing low latency authentication of gated media relay services. For example, in some implementations, a method includes receiving a request for access to a gated media relay service, providing provisional access to the service until an authentication result is available, determining whether the requesting device is authorized to access the media relay service, and at least one of ending or continuing access to the media relay service based on the authentication result.

(abstract)
This disclosure pertains to novel devices, methods, and computer readable media for performing &#x201c;blind&#x201d; color defringing on images. In one embodiment, the blind defringing process begins with blind color edge alignment. This process largely cancels every kind of fringe, except for axial chromatic aberration. Next, the process looks at the edges and computes natural high and low colors to either side of the edge, attempting to get new pixel colors that aren't contaminated by the fringe color. Next, the process resolves the pixel's estimated new color by interpolating between the low and high colors, based on the green variation across the edge and the amount of green in the pixel that is being repaired. Care is taken to prevent artifacts in areas that generally do not fringe, like red-black boundaries and skin tone. Finally, the process computes the final repaired color by using luminance-scaling of the new pixel color estimate.

(predicted title) System power efficiency optimization through multiple memory die
(actual title) Non-volatile memory and method with peak current control
(abstract)
A non-volatile memory with multiple memory dice manages simultaneous operations so as to not exceed a system power capacity. A load signal bus is pulled up with a strength proportional to the system power capacity. Each die has a driver to pull down the bus by an amount corresponding to its degree of power need as estimated by a state machine of the die. The bus therefore provides a load signal that serves as arbitration between the system power capacity and the cumulative loads of the individual dice. The load signal is therefore at a high state when the system power capacity is not exceeded; otherwise it is at a low state. When a die wishes to perform an operation and requests a certain amount of power, it drives the bus accordingly and its state machine either proceeds with the operation or not, depending on the load signal.

(abstract)
Waveform concatenation speech synthesis with high sound quality. Prosody with both high accuracy and high sound quality is achieved by performing a two-path search including a speech segment search and a prosody modification value search. An accurate accent is secured by evaluating the consistency of the prosody by using a statistical model of prosody variations (the slope of fundamental frequency) for both of two paths of the speech segment selection and the modification value search. In the prosody modification value search, a prosody modification value sequence that minimizes a modified prosody cost is searched for. This allows a search for a modification value sequence that can increase the likelihood of absolute values or variations of the prosody to the statistical model as high as possible with minimum modification values.

(predicted title) System and method for temperature controlled ion source
(actual title) Gas coupled arc chamber cooling
(abstract)
An ion implantation system, having a temperature controlled ion source chamber is disclosed. The temperature of the ion source chamber is regulated by disposing a heat sink in proximity to the ion source chamber. A gas fillable chamber is disposed between and in physical communication with both the ion source chamber and the heat sink. By controlling the amount of gas, i.e. the gas pressure, within the gas fillable chamber, the coefficient of heat transfer can be manipulated. This allows the temperature of the ion source chamber to be controlled through the application or removal of gas from the gas fillable chamber. This independent temperature control decouples the power used to heat the ion generator from the ion species that are ultimately generated.

(abstract)
This disclosure is directed to a plate design for use in variable data digital lithographic image forming devices. The disclosed plate design incorporates surface passivated carbon black filler material particles in a fluorosilicone polymer. The disclosed functionalized carbon black material compositions include hydrophobic carbon black particles surface passivated via the use of an A/B-block copolymer where the A/B block contains a pentafluorostyrene-maleimide alternating polymer and the B block contains pure pentafluorostyrene. The A/B portion allows for the polymer to adsorb onto the carbon black while the b-block acts as the stabilizer in fluorinated systems. Fine dispersions result from the addition of poly (pentafluorostyrene/Maleimide-b-pentafluorostyrene) or P(PFS/MI-b-PFS) passivated carbon black to fluorinated polymers, enhancing the physical and mechanical properties. The disclosed surface passivated carbon black particles are particularly usable for improving operational characteristics of fluorosilocone-based reimageable surface layers of imaging members employed in the variable data digital lithographic image forming devices.

(predicted title) Device and method for handover decision based on trigger monitoring
(actual title) Wireless communication system utilizing enhanced air-interface
(abstract)
In a Long Term Evolution (LTE) environment, the LTE network can coordinate with a subscribing user equipment to manage offloading to a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point or other base station. In doing so, the serving base station on the LTE network can acquire device capabilities of the user equipment and provide configuration details to the user equipment based on those capabilities. These configuration details may cause the user equipment to monitor one or more triggers, and may configure a scan to be later performed by the user equipment. Based on the monitored trigger, the user equipment can then scan the environment according to the scan configuration defined by the base station, and relay scan results to the base station to make a handover determination.

A deterministic approach for route selection in the Internet and other multi-homed networks is presented that is based upon a mathematical model that takes into consideration performance and costs while satisfying commitment constraints. The approach is expressed with a linear programming formulation that can be solved with conventional linear programming solver software. Performance metrics can be defined and combined in order to achieve the best route selection depending on requirements. Some of the potential benefits of the approach include: a global optimal solution for routing traffic (using metrics such as performance, cost, and other constraints), a dynamic weight assignment for performance metrics, and a flexible problem definition to add routing rules (e.g. static and restricted routes) to the model.

(actual title) Method and system for providing document retention using cryptography
(abstract)
Techniques for utilizing security criteria to implement document retention for electronic documents are disclosed. The security criteria can also limit when, how and where access to the electronic documents is permitted. The security criteria can pertain to keys (or ciphers) used to secure (e.g., encrypt) electronic files (namely, electronic documents), or to unsecure (e.g., decrypt) electronic files already secured. At least a portion of the security criteria can be used to implement document retention, namely, a document retention policy. After a secured electronic document has been retained for the duration of the document retention policy, the associated security criteria becomes no longer available, thus preventing subsequent access to the secured electronic document. In other words, access restrictions on electronic documents can be used to prevent access to electronic documents which are no longer to be retained.
