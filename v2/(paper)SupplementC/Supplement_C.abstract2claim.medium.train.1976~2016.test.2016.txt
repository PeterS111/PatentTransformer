(abstract)
A method and system is provided for maintaining customer data in a data store system utilizing a scalable partitioning framework. More specifically, the data store of a customer service system is partitioned (divided) into multiple partitions by a partitionable key of customer data so that each partition owns a subset of the customer data. By maintaining several partitions that store a subset of the customer data exclusive to each other, blackout or brownout problems can be local to one partition and, thus, the availability for the entire system will be increased. Moreover, a set of partitionable keys, a minimal unit to be moved between partitions, is grouped and associated with a partition. By eliminating direct dependencies between the partitions and the partitionable keys, the system can have great flexibility with regard to migrating customer data between partitions and adding a new partition.

The blue power generation system includes an electrolytic system to obtain hydrogen and oxygen from sea water. It also includes a power generating system to supply electrical energy to the electrolytic system and an installation to recombine hydrogen and oxygen to produce clean fresh water. More specifically, the deep-sea electrolytic reaction generate gases rising into reservoirs at sea level. As water is depleted in the electrolytic chamber, a low pressure is created in the electrolytic chamber. The pressure of makeup water required for the electrolytic reaction is used to drive a turbine and generate electrical power. A portion of the electrical power generated is used to drive the electrolytic reaction. The amount of electrical energy created is a direct relation with the depth at which the system is operated.

(actual claim) A post driver comprising: <|span|> a weight; <|span|> a fixed upper barrier positioned below the weight, the fixed upper barrier having a through-hole extending therethrough, said hole being sized and shaped to allow at least a portion of the weight to pass at least partially therethrough; <|span|> a fixed lower barrier positioned below the fixed upper barrier, the fixed lower barrier being sized and shaped to allow a post to pass therethrough; <|span|> a floating anvil positioned entirely between the fixed upper barrier and the fixed lower barrier; and <|span|> a driver body, said driver body housing said weight, fixed upper barrier, fixed lower barrier, and <|span|> floating anvil therein, wherein said fixed upper barrier has a fixed position with respect to the driver body; <|span|> wherein said weight is positioned within said driver body to rise above the fixed upper barrier out of contact with the floating anvil and fall into contact with the floating anvil through the through-hole in the fixed upper barrier.
(abstract)
The post driver with limited movement floating post anvil does not rely heavily upon the skill of the operator to efficiently drive posts. The post anvil is allowed to move up and down in relation to the driver, but its movement is limited by both lower and upper fixed barriers. Since the movement is limited, the operator can position the driver upon the post allowing the full weight of the driver framework/carrier machine to rest upon the post. The post would push the floating post anvil upward only to the point at which the upper fixed barrier prevents further upward movement of the floating post anvil. Thus, once the floating post anvil abuts the upper fixed barrier, substantially the entire weight of the post driver is resting on the post.

Acoustic noise in an audio signal is reduced by calculating a speech probability presence (SPP) factor using minimum mean square error (MMSE). The SPP factor, which has a value typically ranging between zero and one, is modified or warped responsive to a value obtained from the evaluation of a sigmoid function, the shape of which is determined by a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is obtained by an evaluation of the signal energy and noise energy output from a microphone over time. The shape and aggressiveness of the sigmoid function is determined using an extrinsically-determined SNR, not determined by the MMSE determination.

(abstract)
The present invention provides a method for preparing carbon nanotube fibers with improved spinning properties using a surfactant and carbon nanotube fibers prepared by the method. According to the method for preparing carbon nanotube fibers of the present invention, the addition of a surfactant during the preparation of carbon nanotubes interrupts and delays the agglomeration of catalyst particles, which reduces the size of the catalyst particles and uniformly disperses the catalyst particles that play a key role in the formation of carbon nanotube fibers, thus increasing the strength and conductivity of carbon nanotube fibers and improving the spinning properties. While convention methods prepare carbon nanotube fibers by injecting a catalytic material for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes in a high-pressure supercritical state to be uniformly dispersed, the present invention uses a dispersant and thus does not require the injection in a high-pressure supercritical state.

(abstract)
An efficient and highly scalable method of sorting an input file in a processing system by using only a limited amount (i.e., a portion) of memory in the processing system, where that amount of memory is substantially smaller than the input file, is disclosed. The input file can be, for example, a fingerprint database for use in deduplication, and the processing system can be, for example, a network storage server. The merge phase is broken down into sub-phases, where each sub-phase takes a predetermined number of subsets of a fingerprint file to merge and writes them back as a sorted, merged group. The number of threads used to process these groups can depend on the number of central processing units (CPUs) present in the system and can be dynamically tuned to achieve desired level of performance.

The method causes a computing device to detect a misrecognized speech query from a user, determine a tendency of the user to repeat speech queries based on previous user interactions, and adapt a speech recognition model based on the determined tendency before an expected repeat speech query. The method can further include recognizing the expected repeat speech query from the user based on the adapted speech recognition model. Adapting the speech recognition model can include modifying an acoustic model, a language model, and a semantic model. Adapting the speech recognition model can also include preparing a personalized search speech recognition model for the expected repeat query based on usage history and entries in a recognition lattice. The method can include retaining unmodified speech recognition models with adapted speech recognition models.

(abstract)
Bone anchors useful in rotator cuff repair optimize the thread pattern for engaging different types of bone tissues, including harder cortical bone and softer cancellous bone. Bone anchors may include fine threads for engaging cortical bone and coarse threads for engaging cancellous bone. Threads can be made finer by increasing root diameter and surface angle of the threads. The pitches of the fine and coarse threads are kept the same, which allows fine threads to follow the impression created by coarse threads as the anchor is driven into a bone. Threads that engage cortical bone can be multi-fluted and include a first flute that follows the same thread pattern as coarse threads such that first flute follows the groove created by the coarse threads as the bone anchor is driven into a bone. Bone anchors can have a distal non-threaded stabilizing extension at the distal end.

A method and system for processing network metadata is described. Network metadata may be processed by dynamically instantiated executable software modules which make policy-based decisions about the character of the network metadata and about presentation of the network metadata to consumers of the information carried by the network metadata. The network metadata may be type classified and each subclass within a type may be mapped to a definition by a unique fingerprint value. The fingerprint value may be used for matching the network metadata subclasses against relevant policies and transformation rules. For template-based network metadata such as NetFlow v9, an embodiment of the invention can constantly monitor network traffic for unknown templates, capture template definitions, and informs administrators about templates for which custom policies and conversion rules do not exist. Conversion modules can efficiently convert selected types and/or subclasses of network metadata into alternative metadata formats.

User input gloves and input methods are described that are well suited to provide input to computer modeling (eg CAD) and augmented reality (AR) systems, including wearable AR and spatial AR. Each glove comprises palm mounted ultrasonic transducers, accelerometers, finger based pinch inputs and a wireless communication module. The gloves can be used to measure distances over the natural range of distances that hands can be placed, as well as their orientation, with sufficient resolution to facilitate a range of gesture based input methods to be developed and utilized, including distance-based modeling by measurement. Further the gloves are light weight, allow fast input of modeling measurements, are easy to use, and reduce fatigue compared to existing glove based input systems. The user input gloves, and associated input techniques can be used to measure small and body sized objects using one or two hands, and large objects can be measured using single handed measurements. Further models for both small and large objects can be generated and manipulated through the use of a numeric input technique to obtain an amplification factor to magnify the effective distances measured.

(abstract)
Plural image planes are illuminated through a single image-collecting objective system. The field of view or magnification (or both), is allocated dynamically among the plural planes. Preferably the planes include two detector planes&#x2014;one corresponding to a wide field of view (FOV) and the other to a steerable narrow one. Allocation is performed by a beam splitter in combination with a steering mirror, or steering-mirror array, that steers both fields together. The splitter isolates radiation corresponding to the narrow FOV from radiation corresponding to the wide FOV. In method forms of the invention, an electrooptical observation system produces simultaneous plural images for a region of interest. The system displays simultaneous images having respective plural resolutions. In operation a first, relatively wider FOV continuously covers a region of interest; while the second is narrower and has finer resolution than the first.

A picker associated with respective FIFO(s) begins an empty arbitration packet that includes a location for each output port and fills one or more locations in the packet, such as based on a prioritization scheme. Each packet is passed in a ring to another picker, which performs a fill that does not conflict with previously filled locations in that packet. Each picker has an opportunity to place requests in each of the packets. Results of the arbitration are dispatched to reorder buffers associated with respective output ports and used to schedule the interconnect. Each arbitration cycle thus produces a set of control information for an interconnect to be used in subsequent data transfer steps.
