(abstract)
A method and system is provided for maintaining customer data in a data store system utilizing a scalable partitioning framework. More specifically, the data store of a customer service system is partitioned (divided) into multiple partitions by a partitionable key of customer data so that each partition owns a subset of the customer data. By maintaining several partitions that store a subset of the customer data exclusive to each other, blackout or brownout problems can be local to one partition and, thus, the availability for the entire system will be increased. Moreover, a set of partitionable keys, a minimal unit to be moved between partitions, is grouped and associated with a partition. By eliminating direct dependencies between the partitions and the partitionable keys, the system can have great flexibility with regard to migrating customer data between partitions and adding a new partition.

(abstract)
The blue power generation system includes an electrolytic system to obtain hydrogen and oxygen from sea water. It also includes a power generating system to supply electrical energy to the electrolytic system and an installation to recombine hydrogen and oxygen to produce clean fresh water. More specifically, the deep-sea electrolytic reaction generate gases rising into reservoirs at sea level. As water is depleted in the electrolytic chamber, a low pressure is created in the electrolytic chamber. The pressure of makeup water required for the electrolytic reaction is used to drive a turbine and generate electrical power. A portion of the electrical power generated is used to drive the electrolytic reaction. The amount of electrical energy created is a direct relation with the depth at which the system is operated.

(predicted claim) A post driver with limited movement floating, comprising: <|span|> a base structure; <|span|> a lifting frame supported from the base structure for movement and anvil assembly including an anvil that is moved relative to the lifting frame as the anvil assembly is raised and lowered and a work piece being moved relative to the anvil during movement of the anvil assembly; <|span|> an adjustment assembly supported from the base structure and configured to move the anvil assembly relative to the lifting frame, the adjustment assembly being configured to allow the anvil to move up to an extension position during movement of the anvil assembly, such that the anvil assembly is free to move axially outward in a direction away from the extension position.
(actual claim) A post driver comprising: <|span|> a weight; <|span|> a fixed upper barrier positioned below the weight, the fixed upper barrier having a through-hole extending therethrough, said hole being sized and shaped to allow at least a portion of the weight to pass at least partially therethrough; <|span|> a fixed lower barrier positioned below the fixed upper barrier, the fixed lower barrier being sized and shaped to allow a post to pass therethrough; <|span|> a floating anvil positioned entirely between the fixed upper barrier and the fixed lower barrier; and <|span|> a driver body, said driver body housing said weight, fixed upper barrier, fixed lower barrier, and <|span|> floating anvil therein, wherein said fixed upper barrier has a fixed position with respect to the driver body; <|span|> wherein said weight is positioned within said driver body to rise above the fixed upper barrier out of contact with the floating anvil and fall into contact with the floating anvil through the through-hole in the fixed upper barrier.
(abstract)
The post driver with limited movement floating post anvil does not rely heavily upon the skill of the operator to efficiently drive posts. The post anvil is allowed to move up and down in relation to the driver, but its movement is limited by both lower and upper fixed barriers. Since the movement is limited, the operator can position the driver upon the post allowing the full weight of the driver framework/carrier machine to rest upon the post. The post would push the floating post anvil upward only to the point at which the upper fixed barrier prevents further upward movement of the floating post anvil. Thus, once the floating post anvil abuts the upper fixed barrier, substantially the entire weight of the post driver is resting on the post.

(abstract)
Acoustic noise in an audio signal is reduced by calculating a speech probability presence (SPP) factor using minimum mean square error (MMSE). The SPP factor, which has a value typically ranging between zero and one, is modified or warped responsive to a value obtained from the evaluation of a sigmoid function, the shape of which is determined by a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is obtained by an evaluation of the signal energy and noise energy output from a microphone over time. The shape and aggressiveness of the sigmoid function is determined using an extrinsically-determined SNR, not determined by the MMSE determination.

Disclosed is a vehicle-like sound generation method wherein an acquisition unit (<b>730</b>A) refers to map information contained in a memory unit (<b>710</b>) based on the current position of a vehicle (MV) detected by a position detection unit (<b>720</b>), acquires lane information including the number of lanes on the road the vehicle (MV) is currently driving on, and sends the acquired lane information to a determination unit (<b>740</b>). Then, the determination unit (<b>740</b>) determines the range of the vehicle-like sound output towards the exterior of the vehicle based on the lane information sent by the acquisition unit (<b>730</b>A). Next, a control unit (<b>750</b>) calculates the volume setting for the vehicle-like sound output from the left and right speakers of a sound output unit (<b>760</b>) based on the determined range. Thus, output of the vehicle-like sound can be controlled while taking into account the probability that persons to be notified are present in surroundings which change due to the type of road currently being driven on.

(abstract)
A method and system for processing network metadata is described. Network metadata may be processed by dynamically instantiated executable software modules which make policy-based decisions about the character of the network metadata and about presentation of the network metadata to consumers of the information carried by the network metadata. The network metadata may be type classified and each subclass within a type may be mapped to a definition by a unique fingerprint value. The fingerprint value may be used for matching the network metadata subclasses against relevant policies and transformation rules. For template-based network metadata such as NetFlow v9, an embodiment of the invention can constantly monitor network traffic for unknown templates, capture template definitions, and informs administrators about templates for which custom policies and conversion rules do not exist. Conversion modules can efficiently convert selected types and/or subclasses of network metadata into alternative metadata formats.

A data processing application uses a translation file to render a visual surface based on underlying structured data. The data processing application provides mapping between nodes associated with the visual surface and nodes associated with the structured data. The mapping is generated in two phases. In a first phase, the data processing application adds mapping functions to the translation file. In the second phase, the data processing application renders the visual surface on the basis of a specific instance of the structured data, and, in the process, executes the mapping functions within the translation file to provide specific pointer information that is embedded amongst the nodes associated with the visual surface. The pointer information points back to specific locations in the structured data, thus providing mapping between the visual surface and the structured data. The structured data can be formed using Extensible Markup Language (XML). The visual surface can be formed using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The translation file can be formed using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).

(abstract)
When a request of a warming-up of a transmission is generated, a hybrid ECU sets a target input rotational speed of the transmission where a heat loss quantity of a MG becomes maximum, based on a request driving force of a vehicle. In this case, the heat loss quantity is a quantity of a heat loss causing an increasing of a temperature of an ATF in the MG. Thus, the hybrid ECU sets the target input rotational speed where the heat loss quantity becomes maximum and controls the transmission and the MG to output power that meets the request driving force of the vehicle. Since the hybrid ECU controls a torque of the MG, a torque of the engine, and a transmission ratio of the transmission to achieve the target input rotational speed, the hybrid ECU controls the MG, the engine, and the transmission in a condition that the heat loss quantity becomes maximum.

(abstract)
A laser sustained plasma light source includes a plasma bulb containing a working gas flow driven by an electric current sustained within the plasma bulb. Charged particles are introduced into the working gas of the plasma bulb. An arrangement of electrodes maintained at different voltage levels drive the charged particles through the working gas. The movement of the charged particles within the working gas causes the working gas to flow in the direction of movement of the charged particles by entrainment. The resulting working gas flow increases convection around the plasma and increases laser to plasma interaction. The working gas flow within the plasma bulb can be stabilized and controlled by control of the voltages present on the each of the electrodes. A more stable flow of working gas through the plasma contributes to a more stable plasma shape and position within the plasma bulb.

Techniques use multiple lower bit depth codecs to provide higher bit depth, high dynamic range, images from an upstream device to a downstream device. A base layer and one or more enhancement layers may be used to carry video signals, wherein the base layer cannot be decoded and viewed on its own. Lower bit depth input image data to base layer processing may be generated from higher bit depth high dynamic range input image data via advanced quantization to minimize the volume of image data to be carried by enhancement layer video signals. The image data in the enhancement layer video signals may comprise residual values, quantization parameters, and mapping parameters based in part on a prediction method corresponding to a specific method used in the advanced quantization. Adaptive dynamic range adaptation techniques take into consideration special transition effects, such as fade-in and fade-outs, for improved coding performance.

Aspects relate to arbitrating access to an interconnect among multiple ports. For example, input ports receive requests for access to identified destination ports and buffer these in one or more FIFOs. A picker associated with respective FIFO(s) begins an empty arbitration packet that includes a location for each output port and fills one or more locations in the packet, such as based on a prioritization scheme. Each packet is passed in a ring to another picker, which performs a fill that does not conflict with previously filled locations in that packet. Each picker has an opportunity to place requests in each of the packets. Results of the arbitration are dispatched to reorder buffers associated with respective output ports and used to schedule the interconnect. Each arbitration cycle thus produces a set of control information for an interconnect to be used in subsequent data transfer steps.
