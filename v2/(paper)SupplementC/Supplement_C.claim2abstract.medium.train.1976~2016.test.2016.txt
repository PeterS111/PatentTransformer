(predicted abstract) The present invention discloses a toy for training the arrow in a selected direction and/or for training a bow in an opposite direction. The bow or arrow has an elastic rear tension band secured to the body at an upper rear point of the body and a lower rear point of the body. There is a first connection point at an upper and a lower point of the body and there is a second connection point at a rear of the arrow. The elastic rear tension band is provided with a first and a second tension points having a variable separation distance from the first and second connection points. The forward end of the elastic tension band is secured by a rear end connector to a housing. The body further has a front end extending beyond the front of the housing and a rear end extending beyond the rear of the housing. The elastic tension band is shaped to form a loop at the rear end of the elastic tension band to which the first and second connector ends are secured. The loop is adapted to fit over a portion of the body where an arrow is to be launched, with the arrow moving in the same direction as the elastic tension band and with the body being free to slide along the arrow. As the body and an arrow moving thereon in the opposite direction and moving toward or away from the forward end of the elastic tension band, the loop may be placed over the portion of the body. The movement of the body relative to the arrow provides a variable force from the rear of the elastic tension band to the forward of the elastic tension band. If the arrow is to be launched, the elastic tension band will compress the arrow toward the forward end of the elastic tension band until the force on the elastic tension band causes the forward end of the elastic tension band to move in a downward direction.
(actual abstract) A bow and arrow toy having a light-weight, foam tipped arrow and a bow with rear and fore tension bands. To load and arm the toy, the rear of the arrow is abutted against the rear tension band and the shaft of the arrow is pressed against the fore tension band and drawn back. As the arrow is drawn back, the shaft of the arrow slides against the fore tension band until the fore tension band falls into an engagement slot along the shaft, causing the fore tension band to also become engaged and tensioned as the arrow is drawn back further. At the fore outside edge of the engagement slot is a catch lip which protrudes outwards from the shaft and functions to guide the fore tension band into the engagement slot if the pressure of the shaft against the fore tension band is not sufficient to cause the fore tension band to slide directly into the engagement slot. The fore tension band is comprised of three interlinked loops, with the central loop being sleeved so as to narrow its effective diameter. The front profile of the fore tension band, from top to bottom, slants rearward, is vertical and slants forward, thereby providing physical guidance for proper horizontal orientation of the arrow. The sleeved central loop differs in color from the top and bottom loops of the fore tension band to facilitate proper horizontal orientation of the arrow.

(actual abstract) Intra prediction is used in state-of-the-art video coding standards such as AVC. The intra prediction modes are coded into the bitstream. Luma and chroma components could potentially have different prediction modes. For chroma components, there are 7 different modes defined in AVC: vertical, horizontal, DC, diagonal directions, and &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d;. Statistics show that the &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d; mode is frequently used, but in AVC, this mode is encoded using more bits than other modes during entropy coding, therefore the coding efficiency is decreased.

(predicted abstract) A new technique for reducing the number of die connections used for power-signality measurements in a multi-chip module is disclosed. Power-signal capacitors and other integrated circuits in the module may be formed out of semiconducting materials instead of conductive layers. The invention utilizes only half the total number of die connection points to provide maximum power-signal capacity to the module. This approach will reduce the number of die connections needed to provide power-signal capacitors and other integrated circuits to the module. The invention results in an increase in an overall reduction in number of die connections required for power-signal measurements by 2 or more.

(predicted abstract) The invention provides magnetic recording disk drive that has an array of magnetic read sensors for reading servo patterns from servo tracks on a magnetic recording disk, and a cross-track offset (COPO) sensor with an ATO offset from a track pitch at different radial positions. The COPO sensor has an adjustable COPO offset, and can be adjusted to match a read sensor with an average width of a desired servo track as defined by the angular offset at different radial positions.
(actual abstract) A two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) disk drive has a disk with servo tracks with a track pitch that varies across the radius of the disk. The servo track pitch (STP) is related to the cross-track spacing (CTS) of the multiple read sensors in the TDMR head structure. The CTS is given by the equation: CTS=(CTO)cos &#x3b8;+(ATO)sin &#x3b8;, where &#x3b8; is the skew angle, and CTO is the cross-track spacing and ATO the along-the-track spacing of the read sensors at zero skew angle. The optimal variable STP profile results in track misregistration reduction because it allows each read sensor to read a different servo half-track and thus noise sources not correlated to noise sources read by the other read sensors. The servo tracks may be arranged into a plurality of annular bands, with the STP in each band being fixed and different from the STP in the other bands.

(predicted abstract) An anti-virus application that senses a potential data exfiltration from an application to a target. The anti-virus application identifies a plurality of data flows between the application and the target, including information on which data flows to and from the target are sensitive. The anti-virus application also includes an analysis process for comparing the data flows and determining whether an unauthorized data flow is detected within each data flow. One or more of the identified data flows may be passed to an agent, which may provide a message to a user about an unauthorized data flow.
(actual abstract) In response to a local Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) agent identifying a potential data exfiltration attack, the binary identified in the attack is sent to a static analysis tool for further analysis. The agent also identifies a source and a sink involved in the potential data exfiltration. The static analysis tool decompiles the binary, and then runs the de-compiled code through a static analysis to identify data flows between the source and the sink, e.g., a data flow from the source that is the method used to read sensitive information, and a data flow to the sink that is the method used to write to the remote system. If there are such data flows, the activity reported by the agent is likely a true exfiltration attack. Based on this flow determination, the static analysis tool returns a response to the agent validating that the activity is an attack.

(actual abstract) Myelodysplastic syndromes display both hematological and biological heterogeneity with variable leukemia potential. To determine whether microRNAs expression offers diagnostic discrimination or influences malignant potential in MDS, bone marrow miRNA expression was investigated from prognostically distinct MDS subsets using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization, data were analyzed indicating thirteen miRNA signature with statistically significant differential expression, including down-regulation of members of a leukemia associated miRNA family. A unique signature consisting of 10 miRNAs was closely associated with International Prognostic Scoring System risk category permitting discrimination between lower and higher risk disease. Selective overexpression of miRNA-181 family members was detected in higher risk MDS, indicating pathogenetic overlap with acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis of miRNA expression profile offers diagnostic utility, and provides pathogenetic and prognostic discimination in MDS.

(predicted abstract) The invention relates to an LED based lighting device and a method of making same. The invention includes a light emitting device formed of a light emitting diode (LED) die bonded to a submount. The submount comprises a transparent, non-porous glass substrate which supports a transparent porous phosphor layer on its surface to overlie the LED die. The phosphor layer comprises phosphor grains sintered together. A first inorganic binder substantially fills all the spaces in the phosphor layer, the binder being formed by cure a sol-gel or liquid glass. A second inorganic sintered binder fills in the spaces in the phosphor layer which remain uncelled by either of the inorganic binder layers. The second phosphor layer can be applied to a different substrate than the first phosphor layer and the phosphor layer can be formed on a different substrate than the inorganic layers. Preferably a first substrate is utilized in which the second phosphor layer is applied over that first substrate and a second substrate is utilized after the first phosphor layer is applied over that second substrate. A support structure such as a frame is placed between the LED die and the first substrate to support the two substrates in a spaced-apart relationship.
(actual abstract) A method for fabricating an LED/phosphor structure is described where an array of blue light emitting diode (LED) dies are mounted on a submount wafer. A phosphor powder is mixed with an organic polymer binder, such as an acrylate or nitrocellulose. The liquid or paste mixture is then deposited over the LED dies or other substrate as a substantially uniform layer. The organic binder is then removed by being burned away in air, or being subject to an O<sub>2 </sub>plasma process, or dissolved, leaving a porous layer of phosphor grains sintered together. The porous phosphor layer is impregnated with a sol-gel (e.g., a sol-gel of TEOS or MTMS) or liquid glass (e.g., sodium silicate or potassium silicate), also known as water glass, which saturates the porous structure. The structure is then heated to cure the inorganic glass binder, leaving a robust glass binder that resists yellowing, among other desirable properties.

(predicted abstract) In induction heating coil systems, it is important to reduce the amount of data sent through the coil for determining key touch to an operator at a touch screen. In most systems in which a coil is used as a heating coil for induction heating, the amount of data sent through the coil does not increase as the coil turns through one revolution at half its capacity. In turn, the amount of data which must be sent through the coil for determining key touch is reduced. In a first example embodiment, the amount of data sent through the coil is reduced by detecting a change in the signal at the coil. If the signal detected during an inductive coil turn is less than a predetermined threshold, then the amount of current is increased. If the signal detected during a capacitive coil turn is greater than the predetermined threshold, then the amount of current is increased. A key touch at the screen is determined when the amount of current exceeds a predetermined limit.

(actual abstract) A method for fabricating custom surface reflectance and spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BDRFs or svBRDFs). The 3D printing method optimizes micro-geometry to produce a normal distribution function (NDF) that can be printed on surfaces with a 3D printer. Particularly, the method involves optimizing the micro-geometry for a wide range of analytic NDFs and simulating the effective reflectance of the resulting surface. Using the results of the simulation, the appearance of an input svBRDF can be reproduced. To this end, the micro-geometry is optimized in a data-driven fashion and distributed on the surface of the printed object. The methods were demonstrated to allow 3D printing svBRDF on planar samples with current 3D printing technology even with a limited set of printing materials, and the described methods have been shown to be naturally extendable to printing svBRDF on arbitrary shapes or 3D objects.

(predicted abstract) A corrosion resistant string of electrical and electronic electrical and magnetic sound-dampening type comprises a bare core wire, a wrap wire and a bondable coating material. The core wire is coated with the bondable material without any substantial change in the shape (e.g. in the shape of a strip of metal, metallic coated ceramic or polymeric material) and the wrap wire extends around the core wire. This is accomplished by wrapping the core wire around the wrap wire using the wrap wire at one or more points along its length thus forming a non-coated wire. The non-coated wire is then heated and heated coated with the bondable material to at least bond the coating to the core wire, and then, cooled and cured.

The method improves the core wire-to-wrap wire bond by using a bond coating between the core and wrap wires that preferably also minimizes the galvanic activity between them. The bondable coating is applied to the core or wrap wires, or both. In one embodiment the method entails creating a coated core wire by annealing bare core wire, bathing the bare core wire in a bondable coating material and removing any excess, drying the bondable coating, making the string using the bondable-coated core wire, and reflowing the bondable coating. In another embodiment the method entails additionally coating the wrap wire with a coating that does not reflow under the same conditions as the bondable coating on the core wire, and winding the coated wrap wire around the bondable-coated core wire before reflowing the bondable coating.

(predicted abstract) Systems and methods for detecting and analyzing light transmitted across a display element. In certain embodiments, a computing device comprises a display element; a cover glass element; an IR emitter positioned to direct IR radiation into a first location of the lip region; and an IR detector positioned to detect the IR radiation transmitted across the portion of the cover glass element. An intensity pattern of detected IR radiation for the portion of the lip region at a time that the computing device is being held is determined. One or more differences between the intensity pattern and a baseline intensity pattern is determined. Further, the computing device can perform an action corresponding to a known user input received via the portion of the lip region.
(actual abstract) An optically transmissive element of a computing device can be used to enable touch input. One or more light sources, such as infrared (IR) light emitting diodes (LEDs), can direct radiation into an edge of the transmissive element and direct light to reflect from at least one other side or edge using total internal reflection (TIR). The transmissive element can have one or more curved or shaped regions, the extent of which can affect the amount of light lost from the element due to less than TIR at those regions. If a user places a finger at a position where the light internally reflects, a portion of the light will be transmitted out of the element causing a reduction in the amount of light received to one or more light sensors. By monitoring patterns of intensity loss, the locations of user inputs can be determined.

(predicted abstract) A laser assembly for use with a microscope for manipulating a sample held or supported on a stage of the microscope comprises an objective having an optical axis and being constructed and arranged to receive an image beam having an image plane. The laser assembly further includes a laser light generation assembly for generating laser light. Additionally, an optical injection assembly is provided for introducing the laser light having a predetermined optical path length to the objective. The optical path may be selected from the group consisting of a single line, a multiple line, and a dual line. The predetermined optical path length of the optical injection assembly is a function of a distance between a stage and the objective. To enhance contrast between the sample and the image plane of the image beam, the laser assembly employs a beam collimating lens for adjusting the optical path length to match the distance between the stage and the objective.
(actual abstract) A laser assembly is provided which includes an objective assembly having an objective and a dichroic mirror, a collimating assembly having a collimating lens and a selectively displaceable mount, and a laser supply assembly having a laser source. The laser assembly can provide laser light through the collimating lens, which collimates the laser light into a collimated beam. The laser beam is preferably transmitted onto the dichroic mirror, which reflects the laser light through the objective along the optical path of the objective which converges into a focal point. Such a laser assembly preferably provides substantial control of the laser beam, for example, for micromanipulation of a sample.

(predicted abstract) A supercriticalylene cycle power generation system may include a first valve, a processor, a heater, and a sensor. A first piping provides a fluid from the outlet port of the heater to the inlet port of a turbine. A second piping provides the fluid from the outlet port of the turbine to the heater. A first valve is positioned on the first piping. The first valve is operative to direct fluid in the first piping to flow to the second piping when the first valve is open. A heater is coupled to the first piping. The heater is operative to heat the fluid. A sensor is coupled to the first piping. The sensor is operative to output a temperature of the fluid. A processor is in communication with the sensor. The processor is operative to control the first valve's open or closed position based at least in part upon the temperature output by the sensor so that when the temperature of the fluid at the inlet port of the turbine is below a predefined threshold temperature, the processor causes the first valve to be in an open position. The fluid drives the turbine to charge air by compressing the fluid, and the processor controls the first valve so that when the temperature output by the sensor is below the predefined threshold temperature, the processor causes the first valve to be in an open position to direct fluid exiting from the heater to the inlet of the turbine.
