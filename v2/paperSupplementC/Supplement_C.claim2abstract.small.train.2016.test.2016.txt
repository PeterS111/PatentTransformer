(predicted abstract) The present invention relates to a method for managing waterborne stress in plants. The method includes placing the plant in communication with a temperature sensor which is positioned in close proximity to the temperature of a target plant for temperature-dependent measurement of the humidity in the vicinity of the plant while the plant is within an operational range of the plant, monitoring the temperature of the plant during a first time interval when the plant is within an operational range, and monitoring the temperature of the plant during a second interval when the plant is outside an operational range. The invention also can also comprise a corresponding device for controlling a plant in a manner that is suitable for irrigation.
(actual abstract) The water-deficit stress of plants or crops is managed using plant temperatures to maximize product quality. The temperature of the target plant is repeatedly measured over a period of interest, and after each measurement, the plant temperature is compared with a predetermined plant setpoint temperature associated with a desired water-deficit stress level, above which temperature the plant is deemed to be in an undesired metabolic state. If the measured plant temperature is greater than the setpoint temperature, and humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation can be triggered to retain the plant within the desired stressed level, as determined by the temperature of the plant. By this method, irrigation can be withheld to increase plant temperature or applied to reduce plant temperature. The temperature of the plant is thus continuously increased and decreased relative to a desired temperature value that is indicative of a desired water-deficit stress.

(actual abstract) Intra prediction is used in state-of-the-art video coding standards such as AVC. The intra prediction modes are coded into the bitstream. Luma and chroma components could potentially have different prediction modes. For chroma components, there are 7 different modes defined in AVC: vertical, horizontal, DC, diagonal directions, and &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d;. Statistics show that the &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d; mode is frequently used, but in AVC, this mode is encoded using more bits than other modes during entropy coding, therefore the coding efficiency is decreased. Accordingly, a modified binarization/codeword assignment for chroma intra mode signaling is able to be utilized for high efficiency video coding (HEVC), the next generation video coding standard.

The disk drive controller sends the disk address the head address to a disk controller in communication with the disk drive controller and configured to receive the head address from the disk controller.
(actual abstract) A two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) disk drive has a disk with servo tracks with a track pitch that varies across the radius of the disk. The servo track pitch (STP) is related to the cross-track spacing (CTS) of the multiple read sensors in the TDMR head structure. The CTS is given by the equation: CTS=(CTO)cos &#x3b8;+(ATO)sin &#x3b8;, where &#x3b8; is the skew angle, and CTO is the cross-track spacing and ATO the along-the-track spacing of the read sensors at zero skew angle. The optimal variable STP profile results in track misregistration reduction because it allows each read sensor to read a different servo half-track and thus noise sources not correlated to noise sources read by the other read sensors. The servo tracks may be arranged into a plurality of annular bands, with the STP in each band being fixed and different from the STP in the other bands.

(actual abstract) In response to a local Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) agent identifying a potential data exfiltration attack, the binary identified in the attack is sent to a static analysis tool for further analysis. The agent also identifies a source and a sink involved in the potential data exfiltration. The static analysis tool decompiles the binary, and then runs the de-compiled code through a static analysis to identify data flows between the source and the sink, e.g., a data flow from the source that is the method used to read sensitive information, and a data flow to the sink that is the method used to write to the remote system. If there are such data flows, the activity reported by the agent is likely a true exfiltration attack. Based on this flow determination, the static analysis tool returns a response to the agent validating that the activity is an attack.

(actual abstract) A closed-loop system for insulin infusion overnight uses a model predictive control algorithm (&#x201c;MPC&#x201d;). Used with the MPC is a glucose measurement error model which was derived from actual glucose sensor error data. That sensor error data included both a sensor artifacts component, including dropouts, and a persistent error component, including calibration error, all of which was obtained experimentally from living subjects. The MPC algorithm advised on insulin infusion every fifteen minutes. Sensor glucose input to the MPC was obtained by combining model-calculated, noise-free interstitial glucose with experimentally-derived transient and persistent sensor artifacts associated with the FreeStyle Navigator&#xae; Continuous Glucose Monitor System (&#x201c;FSN&#x201d;). The incidence of severe and significant hypoglycemia reduced 2300- and 200-fold, respectively, during simulated overnight closed-loop control with the MPC algorithm using the glucose measurement error model suggesting that the continuous glucose monitoring technologies facilitate safe closed-loop insulin delivery.

Using the results of the simulation, the appearance of an input svBRDF can be reproduced. To this end, the micro-geometry is optimized in a data-driven fashion and distributed on the surface of the printed object. The methods were demonstrated to allow 3D printing svBRDF on planar samples with current 3D printing technology even with a limited set of printing materials, and the described methods have been shown to be naturally extendable to printing svBRDF on arbitrary shapes or 3D objects.

(predicted abstract) A computing device has an infrared sensor. The infrared sensor is positioned to detect IR radiation reflected through the cover glass and emitted from a second location on the cover glass. A processor determines one or more differences between intensity patterns of detected IR radiation and baseline intensity patterns of detected IR radiation corresponding to a same portion of the lip region. The processor also monitors intensity patterns of detected IR radiation corresponding to the same portion of the lip region. A user input is received via the portion of the lip region. The user input indicates which of the detected IR radiation corresponding to the portion of the lip region can be detected when intensity patterns for which reflected IR radiation has been identified are indicated as greater than baseline levels. The computing device communicates with a user via a wireless communication link. An action is performed in response to the user input.
(actual abstract) An optically transmissive element of a computing device can be used to enable touch input. One or more light sources, such as infrared (IR) light emitting diodes (LEDs), can direct radiation into an edge of the transmissive element and direct light to reflect from at least one other side or edge using total internal reflection (TIR). The transmissive element can have one or more curved or shaped regions, the extent of which can affect the amount of light lost from the element due to less than TIR at those regions. If a user places a finger at a position where the light internally reflects, a portion of the light will be transmitted out of the element causing a reduction in the amount of light received to one or more light sensors. By monitoring patterns of intensity loss, the locations of user inputs can be determined.
