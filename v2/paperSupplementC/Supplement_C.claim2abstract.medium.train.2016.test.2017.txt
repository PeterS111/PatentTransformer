(actual abstract) Disclosed herein is a method of changing characteristics of an electronic device, including the steps of: applying light to an electronic device through a plurality of media having different refractive indexes from each other, the electrical characteristics of the electronic device being changed depending on the amount of incident light; and changing an incident angle of light applied the electronic device to adjust the amount of incident light. There is provided a method of providing light incident angle dependency by a simple procedure of accumulating additional media in various electronic devices. In the method, the light incident angle selectivity of the electronic device can be maintained even when the inclination angle of the device is changed depending on the axis parallel to the incident direction of light even though the incident direction thereof is fixed. This means that the performance of the device can be controlled only by changing the inclination angle of the device without greatly changing the dynamic state of the device. Further, since the movement speed of photons is higher than that of electrons and the signal interference of photons is lower than that of electrons, an additional effect of increasing the operating speed of the device or decreasing the size of the device can be expected.

(predicted abstract) Embodiments of the present disclosure describe digital controller systems configured for use in a vehicle. A digital controller may be configured to output a control signal indicating whether, during a normal operation mode of a controller, a line coupled to the controller is open. When the line is open, a boost inductor current (I<sub>IN</sub>) is output. A switch device may be configured to operate in a predetermined configuration for causing the boost inductor current to pass through in response to the control signal indicating that the line is open. The boost inductor current input may be based on the line being open, and the boost inductor current passing through the boost inductor may be used to determine the voltage and/or current flowing from the controller to a power storage element (e.g., an electric motor of a vehicle or a plug-in module thereof).
(actual abstract) Boost-type switch-mode rectifiers (SMR) commonly use a resistor or a magnetic current sensor to measure the instantaneous input or inductor current that is used as the feedback to the current controller. A novel current sensorless scheme is described that computes the inductor current from the measured inductor voltage in a single-phase boost-type SMR using an adaptive low pass filter. This calculation requires an estimate of the inductance and the equivalent series resistance of the inductor coil. Both these parameters are dependent on operating conditions and are updated continuously. This is done using an adaptive model of the inductor that computes these parameters of the inductor once in every half cycle of the input current. The adaptation scheme is robust against parameter variations. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique which provides comparable performance to standard measured feedback current scheme both under steady-state and transient conditions.

(predicted abstract) A magnetoresistive element has a seed layer, a reference layer, and a storage layer. The seed layer, which is composed of a ferromagnetic fixed layer and a ferromagnetic free layer each having a predetermined element, is located between the reference layer and a tunnel barrier layer. The reference layer is composed of a ferromagnetic fixed layer and a ferromagnetic free layer, and magnetic anisotropy is pinned in the ferromagnetic free layer by an inductive field. The storage layer is composed of a non-magnetic at least partly antiferromagnetic material. This structure enables the spin-valve to be magnetic tunnel junction magnetic tunnel junction, having high free magnetic anisotropy, while a higher transverse flux source density will be used. Moreover, the total thickness of the element can be reduced, without increasing the storage current, so as to make the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetization quality of the element available, and at the same time, to avoid the decrease of temperature characteristic of the element.
(actual abstract) A magnetoresistive element has a crystalline structural quality and magnetic anisotropy enhancement bilayer (CSMAE bilayer) with a). enhanced the crystalline structural quality, hence fabrication yield, of the resulting magnetoresistive element; and b). enhanced the magnetic anisotropy of the recording layer whereby achieving a high MR ratio for the magnetoresistive element with a simultaneous reduction of an undesirable spin pumping effect. As the magnetoresistive film is thermally annealed, a crystallization process occurs to form bcc CoFe grains having epitaxial growth with (100) plane parallel to the surface of the tunnel barrier layer as Boron elements migrate into the impurity absorbing layer. Removing the top portion of the impurity absorbing layer by means of sputtering etch or RIE etch processes followed by optional oxidization process, a thin but thermally stable portion of impurity absorbing layer is formed on top of the magnetoresistive element with a low damping constant. Accordingly, a reduced write current can be achieved for spin-transfer torque MRAM application.

(actual abstract) Techniques are described for using velocity data to improve the location accuracy of Wi-Fi crowdsourcing. Instead of relying on a reported location of an electronic device that detects a communication node, such as an Access Point (AP), the location of the communication node is adjusted based on the velocity of the electronic device when the electronic device detected the communication node. When a communication node is detected, the electronic device associates the device's location coordinates and associated velocity with the detected communication nodes to create data that is tagged with the identity of the communication nodes. The communication node data is sent to a location service for processing to estimate the location of the communication nodes. The location service may adjust the location of a communication node to be a specified distance from the location of the electronic device. In some cases, the higher the velocity, the greater the specified distance.

(actual abstract) Potable drinking water is a scarce resource in many parts of developing countries, especially rural areas. Due to limited financial means of these countries, low cost point-of-use systems are thought to be appropriate technology to treat water. Systems using solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation could be successful since many vulnerable countries are located where solar radiation is intense and abundant throughout the year. The goal of this disclosure is to develop a simple and low cost point-of-use solar UV reactor to disinfect water. In this disclosure wavelength-dependent microbial dose-response behavior was investigated using surrogates to pathogenic microbes. A solar radiation prediction method based on the SMARTS model was used to predict solar UV intensity as function of geographic location and time. A numerical modeling procedure using the discrete ordinate (DO) model and CFD software (FLUENT) was used to simulate UV dose (distribution) delivery to microorganisms. Then, the dose distribution was combined with the dose response behavior using a segregated flow model to predict microbial inactivation by the reactor. A prototype was produced and tested to validate the numerical modeling procedure. The inactivation results from the prototype were in agreement with numerical inactivation prediction. The modeling procedure permits parameters such as reactor dimensions and material properties to be varied to meet a treatment goal.

(predicted abstract) The invention pertains to a method of using an intraocular probe for delivering light to a targeted tissue of a patient that utilizes light delivered by a light source of a probe to direct the light to the target tissue. The probe can provide a probe that comprises an internal portion. The internal portion includes a light conduit including a light source operable to direct light into a tissue of a patient by way of light emission from the probe.
(actual abstract) An intraocular light probe has a mask or shield affixed at its distal end thereof which forms a directed light beam for intraocular application of light to target tissues or intraocular application of therapeutic light. The mask or shield serves to more fully focus, intensify and direct the beam toward the target tissues. The mask or shield also helps direct light away from other tissues and away from the eyes of the surgeon. By placing a light probe beneath a surgical instrument such as a phacoemulsifier or vitrector, laser, cutting instrument (e.g., scissors or knife), forceps or probe/manipulator, whether as part of or separate from an infusion sleeve, a mask or shield effect is created. This has the same benefits of directing the beam toward target tissues, away from other tissues and away from the eyes of the surgeon. The mask/shield can be removed from the fiberoptic light for sterilization. The device of the invention is preferably introduced into the eye via the primary or side-port incision to provide intraocular cross-lighting of tissues during surgical procedures such as cataract surgery, corneal surgery, vitrectomy, intraocular lens implantation, refractive surgery, glaucoma surgery and vitreo/retinal surgery.
