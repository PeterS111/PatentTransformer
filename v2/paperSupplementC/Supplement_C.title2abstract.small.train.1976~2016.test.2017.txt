In the context of a volume snapshot which may involve (i) taking virtual machine snapshots of all virtual machines associated with the volume, (ii) taking the volume snapshot, and (iii) removing all the virtual machine snapshots, the virtual machine snapshots may be created in a first order and removed in a second order. Specifically, snapshots for busy virtual machines (i.e., virtual machines with higher disk write activity) may be created last and removed first. Consequently, snapshots of busy virtual machines are retained for shorter periods of time, thereby minimizing the effect of virtual machine snapshots on those virtual machines (and their associated hypervisors) that would be most negatively impacted by virtual machine snapshots.

The tool comprises a body having upper and lower members connected by a shear component. A rod is connected to the upper member, and the tool can be lowered with the rod into the wellbore or drill string to a desired depth. At the desired depth, locking means are deployed to lock the tool in position, the tool is sealed, and cement can be injected through the tool to the annulus of the outer casing. In some embodiments the tool is locked using a pushing motion that extends locking members outwardly from the tool to engage the wellbore walls or the inner surfaces of the drill string. Once cementing is completed, the rod is pulled from surface thereby causing the shear component to rupture and the upper and lower members to disconnect, and the upper member can be drawn to surface leaving the rest of the tool downhole. The tool does not require rotation to recover the rod, hence reducing the risk of loosening the threaded connections of lengths of drill pipe.

In accordance with an embodiment, the system uses a failure casting hierarchy to cast failures of one type into failures of another type. In doing this, the system allows incidents, problems, or failures to be cast into a (typically smaller) set of failures, which the system knows how to handle. In accordance with a particular embodiment, failures can be cast into a category that is considered reboot-curable. If a failure is reboot-curable then rebooting the system will likely cure the problem. Examples include hardware failures, and reboot-specific methods that can be applied to disk failures and to failures within clusters of databases. The system can even be used to handle failures that were hitherto unforeseen&#x2014;failures can be cast into known failures based on the failure symptoms, rather than any underlying cause.

The microcapsules, which are distributed in a TIM gap filler, each have a shell that encapsulates a solvent. One or more organosilane-coated magnetic nanoparticles is/are covalently bound into the shell of each microcapsule. In one embodiment, (3-aminopropyl) trimethylsilane-coated magnetite nanoparticles are incorporated into the shell of a urea-formaldehyde (UF) microcapsule during in situ polymerization. To enable easy removal of one substrate affixed to another substrate by the enhanced TIM gap filler, the substrates are positioned within a magnetic field sufficient to rupture the microcapsule shells through magnetic stimulation of the organosilane-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The ruptured microcapsule shells release the solvent, which dissolves and/or swells the TIM gap filler, thereby reducing the bond strength between the substrates.

(predicted abstract) A process of calculating line feed error in labels on a printer includes selecting a number of label-storing areas on a label stack, each of the label-storing areas containing a label, calculating a number of feed marks based on an identification of the label, for the number of label-storing areas, calculating a number of strip marks based on an identification of a strip on the printer, calculating a number of feed marks from the number of feed marks, calculating a number of strip marks from the number of strip marks, calculating an error between the number of strip marks and the number of feed marks, and calculating a number of label-storing marks based on the error.
(actual abstract) A system to calculate line feed error in labels on a printer includes a holder assembly under the label line feed and before the printer burn line; a first sensor and a second sensor on the holder assembly, a fixed distance, L, between them; and a processor. The first sensor senses a first position of a label edge, L1A. The second sensor senses a second position of the label edge, L1B. The processor calculates the distance, L1AB, between the first position and the second position and calculates the line feed error over the fixed distance, L, by taking the difference (L&#x2212;L1AB). The processor calculates the feed correction to be done to the label, given by [(L&#x2212;L1AB)/L]&#xd7;D, where D is a distance between the first sensor and the burn line of the printer. The processor instructs the printer line feed to implement the calculated feed correction.

(predicted abstract) The invention is directed to a method for converting a digital video signal received by a video input device into a bit stream that has a resolution corresponding to the format of such a digital video signal. The invention is embodied as a display system comprising a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter for converting the bit stream into a digital video signal by performing an addition or subtraction operation between the bit stream and a reference video signal, the display system further having a display controller for controlling the display to display an image or video signal based upon the comparison between a first signal and a second signal. According to the invention, the method includes determining, based upon a level of the first signal, whether to refram the digital video signal. The display controller is preferably provided with a controller for controlling said display and selecting the second signal from said display based upon the determination of the level of the first signal. The first signal is based upon a luminance signal and the second signal is at least one of a luminance signal associated with a display screen and a luminance signal associated with an input device. An apparatus for implementing the above-mentioned control method is also provided and includes a processor for controlling said display.
(actual abstract) Reframing is used to re-size an image or video content, e.g. for displaying video signals with a given aspect ratio on a display having a different aspect ratio. Window cropping parameters (position and size over time) are constrained in order to optimise the rate/distortion of the encoded output video signal. Initial reframing is improved by computing a saliency map representing a user attention map which considers the video coding context and by providing a macroblock coding efficiency cost map and then taking the saliency map or a combined saliency/coding cost map into account so that the coding cost for said reframed video signal is smaller than the coding cost for other candidate reframing windows' sizes and positions.

(predicted abstract) A radio link control reset for an apparatus. The reset may be implemented by performing an initial reset, transmitting a control signal via a radio frequency channel, receiving feedback from the radio frequency channel, and transmitting via the radio frequency channel an indication of whether the control signal was received. An implementation according to one embodiment of the present invention is to determine to reset the radio link control reset in response to the feedback received from the radio frequency channel.
(actual abstract) A method and apparatus are described for implementing a reset procedure for radio link control (RLC) using radio resource control (RRC) signaling. A wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) receives a request for RLC reset. A processor at the WTRU comprises a RRC entity and a RLC entity. The RRC entity receives the request for a RLC reset in a radio resource control message. The RLC entity reassembles RLC service data units (SDUs) from any protocol data units (PDUs) that are received out of sequence at a receiving side of the RLC entity. The reassembled SDUs are delivered in sequence to a packet data convergence protocol entity (PDCP). At the receiving side of the RLC entity, any remaining PDUs that are not able to be reassembled are discarded. At a transmitting side of the RLC entity, all SDUs and PDUs stored in transmit buffers are discarded.

(actual abstract) An apparatus and method for extending the scalability and improving the partitionability of networks that contain all-to-all links for transporting packet traffic from a source endpoint to a destination endpoint with low per-endpoint (per-server) cost and a small number of hops. An all-to-all wiring in the baseline topology is decomposed into smaller all-to-all components in which each smaller all-to-all connection is replaced with star topology by using global switches. Stacking multiple copies of the star topology baseline network creates a multi-planed switching topology for transporting packet traffic. Point-to-point unified stacking method using global switch wiring methods connects multiple planes of a baseline topology by using the global switches to create a large network size with a low number of hops, i.e., low network latency. Grouped unified stacking method increases the scalability (network size) of a stacked topology.

(predicted abstract) A method of improving the response of a quadrature-amplitude modulator and a PLL circuit to a gyroscope to improve the signal to noise ratio, includes performing a quadrature phase shift operation to the input signal. The quadrature phase shift operation controls a local oscillator, which is used to achieve the quadrature-amplitude modulator's linearity. The quadrature phase shift operation may be performed by generating a local oscillator signal and a feedback signal, then mixing the local oscillator signal and the feedback signal. The mixing and mixing may be applied to a quadrature modulator or a quadrature amplitude modulator to eliminate the effects of the quadrature-amplitude modulator and/or to improve the noise to noise ratio. The quadrature phase shift operation may be performed in the same manner as in the quadrature amplitude modulator, so that a modulator operating at a quadrature frequency may be operated in the same manner as a quadrature-amplitude modulator.

(predicted abstract) The present invention discloses a processing apparatus and method of synchronizing a first processing unit and a second processing unit. The processing apparatus and method of the present invention provide an efficient technique for implementing an asynchronous asynchronous operating system, which is effective in achieving an improved synchronization between a host computer and a peripheral device. An asynchronous operating system includes a microprocessor and a second processing unit. The microprocessor includes a first signal receiving unit, which reads data from the second processing unit and a second signal converting unit, to which the read data is outputted. The second signal converting unit converts the read data to converted data when the read data is outputted. The read data is outputted at a predetermined timing. The second processing unit executes a predetermined process which is specific to the second processing unit, upon receiving the converted data. It is unnecessary for the second processing unit to execute an interrupt. Therefore, because it is required to store data for processing of another device within an isolated region, the present invention will prevent the interrupted processing and interrupt from being executed while the other device is processing the data.
(actual abstract) A processing apparatus, comprising at least a first processing unit and a second processing unit, is proposed. The first processing unit comprises a set of first stateful elements, the second processing unit comprises a set of second stateful elements. A set of synchronization data lines may connect the first stateful elements to the second stateful elements in a pairwise manner. A control unit may control the first processing unit, the second processing unit and the synchronization data lines so as to copy the states of the first stateful elements in parallel via the synchronization data lines to the second stateful elements in response to a synchronization request. A method of synchronizing the processing units is also proposed.

(actual abstract) A new framework for video compressed sensing models the evolution of the image frames of a video sequence as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, from which the image frames are then reconstructed. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably yet obtain video recovery at a high frame rate that is in fact inversely proportional to the length of the video sequence. This property makes our framework well-suited for high-speed video capture and other applications. We validate our approach with a range of experiments including classification experiments that highlight the purposive nature of our framework.

The first substrate, the second substrate, the first insulating layer, the at least one heating element, the at least one electrode, and the second insulating layer each have a through hole in which the at least one electrode is inserted.
(actual abstract) The present disclosure generally comprises a heated showerhead assembly that may be used to supply processing gases into a processing chamber. The processing chamber may be an etching chamber. When processing gas is evacuated from the processing chamber, the uniform processing of the substrate may be difficult. As the processing gas is pulled away from the substrate and towards the vacuum pump, the plasma, in the case of etching, may not be uniform across the substrate. Uneven plasma may lead to uneven etching. To prevent uneven etching, the showerhead assembly may be separated into two zones each having independently controllable gas introduction and temperature control. The first zone corresponds to the perimeter of the substrate while the second zone corresponds to the center of the substrate. By independently controlling the temperature and the gas flow through the showerhead zones, etching uniformity of the substrate may be increased.

(actual abstract) A simulator for a switched electronic power converter circuit feeding a load/device uses a modified FAMNM solver. Provided is a method/system for reducing/eliminating spurious power losses and transients inherently caused by the FAMNM solver using an L/C element approach, wherein a switching device in the &#x2018;on&#x2019; state is featured as an inductor L, and a switching device that is in the &#x2018;off&#x2019; state is featured as either a capacitance C or series-connected resistance and capacitance R-C. The invention uses cross-initialization of the L/C switching elements to their final state of current and voltage when they change their conduction state. The correct cross-initialization is enabled from optional pre-stored tables of events and the system-states at the time of the cross-initialization. The inventive method is an enhancement over known Dommel and Pejovic type FAMNM solvers. The simulator applies to real-time or non-real time simulators and is suitable for all power converter topologies.

(actual abstract) The present invention is a robotic system for maintaining product inventory and dispensing products upon request from a customer or other user. Product items are stored in an inventory storage unit (ISU), one item per bin. Controller logic allows items to be stored in, and retrieved from, arbitrarily-assigned storage locations. The bins hang on rails within drawers. In a replenishment operation, the system transfers empty bins to an operator station for replenishment. An operator fills the empty bins with product items. The system inserts these bins into drawers in the ISU. In a purge operation, the operator enters an identifier of a class of product to be removed. The system moves the bins containing the affected items to the operator station. After the product items are removed, the empty bins are moved to the ISU.

(actual abstract) Ray tracing, and more generally, graphics operations taking place in a 3-D scene, involve a plurality of constituent graphics operations. Responsibility for executing these operations can be distributed among different sets of computation units. The sets of computation units each can execute a set of instructions on a parallelized set of input data elements and produce results. These results can be that the data elements can be categorized into different subsets, where each subset requires different processing as a next step. The data elements of these different subsets can be coalesced so that they are contiguous in a results set. The results set can be used to schedule additional computation, and if there are empty locations of a scheduling vector (after accounting for the members of a given subset), then those empty locations can be filled with other data elements that require the same further processing as that subset.

(predicted abstract) A system and method for cleaving a semiconductor substrate is described which is characterized by the use of a thin film of a low stress material that forms a permanent support structure or substrate. Substrate cleaving is accomplished by applying a stress force to the substrate. This technique can be used with other types of substrates and can be used to cleave the substrate without the use of additional layers or to provide additional support elements.
(actual abstract) A thickness of material may be detached from a substrate along a cleave plane, utilizing a cleaving process controlled by a releasable constraint plate. In some embodiments this constraint plate may comprise a plate that can couple side forces (the &#x201c;P-plate&#x201d;) and a thin, softer compliant layer (the &#x201c;S-layer&#x201d;) situated between the P-plate and the substrate. In certain embodiments a porous surface within the releasable constraint plate and in contact to the substrate, allows the constraint plate to be secured to the substrate via a first pressure differential. Application of a combination of a second pressure differential within a pre-existing cleaved portion, and a linear force to a side of the releasable constraint plate bound to the substrate, generates loading that results in controlled cleaving along the cleave plane.

The method further includes converting one or more event data sets from multiple types of events to a single type of event data in response to the processing condition, wherein the events are based on a temporal distribution of event data and the single type of event data. The method further includes combining the single type of event data with one or more of the event data sets.
(actual abstract) The technology relates to techniques for the attachment of priorities and/or reaction time limits to various entities of a system such as, for example, events, event types, queries, etc. The system's processing may be tailored behavior to match these boundary conditions while at the same time increasing (and sometimes even maximizing) the rate of events processed. Advantageously, the system may be made to adapt its behavior to the current situation, which is changeable and may even be changing quite frequently, e.g., as in connection with a potentially rapidly changing stream. Users may, for example, specify policies to control this adaptation and, thus, events (including events of special interest) may be handled appropriately, even in response to changing conditions.

(predicted abstract) A method and apparatus is disclosed for use in detecting and compensating for a leakage current path of a storage capacitor. In one embodiment, the method includes the use of a first and a second diode connected together in a shunt configuration of the storage capacitor. The first diode is connected across a gate of a control transistor connected between a drain and a source of a transistor in a storage capacitor. The drain and gate of the control transistor are connected to a source of the transistor, and the drain and source of the transistor are connected to a first and a second reference voltage. A first current is measured using the first reference voltage and a gate of a second current measuring transistor is located at a drain of the second transistor and connected to the second diode and connected to the drain of the control transistor. A voltage across the storage capacitor is calculated using the values of the first and the second currents determined from the first diode. If the voltage across the storage capacitor exceeds the second reference voltage, a voltage offset for the second diode is measured. This voltage offset for the control transistor is then applied to the second diode and the control transistor, and the resulting current from the second diode is measured. The current through the storage capacitor and the transistor is compensated for the leakage current.
(actual abstract) Methods, a memory device, and a system are disclosed. One such method includes applying a select pulse to a snapback device of a memory cell.

(predicted abstract) A single collecting light guide for use with a scintillator system, or of some other type, is used to direct the radiation to a collection region of a sample, and to direct the radiation from the collection region back to a single detector where it is detected. As the scintillator is scanned, light reflected from the scintillator will be detected. The output of the sample is detected by a detector. As the detector is scanned, the scintillator can be scanned so that the light reflected from the scintillator passes directly into the sample, and can be detected directly. The radiation can be transmitted through the single collecting light guide and is detected using the single detector. Also, any other radiation can be transmitted to the single detector, and the detector and any other radiation can be detected using a single detector.
(actual abstract) Various embodiments are described herein for a radiation dosimetry apparatus and associated methods for measuring radiation dose. In some embodiments, the apparatus includes multiple scintillating elements for detecting amounts of radiation dose at multiple points within a detection region. Each of the scintillating elements generates light in response to radiation interacting within their volume. A light guide combines the light generated by all of the scintillating elements as well as radiation-induced contaminated optical energy and transmits the combined light to a spectral analysis setup. Multi or hyper-spectral calibration technique allows calculating the dose or dose rate at the positions of the different scintillating elements. The calibration technique isolates the light produced by a given scintillating element from the other scintillating elements as well as any other source of radiation-induced contaminating light.

This system of copings and abutments provides properties of conversion and extension of the implants. Its shape provides better occlusal stability and favorable biomechanics, since the forces are better distributed, diminishing the concentration of tension on the fitting platform of the implant, as well as the screws. The abutments of the universal coupling can be readjusted and be cemented or screwed. In the present system, the superior platform of the coping and the inferior base of the abutment are universalized, since the inferior platform of the coping corrects the slant of the implant. It has screws for fastening and for locking of the coping/abutment set. The characteristics of this system provide great versatility, which allows it to be used in various areas of medicine.

The generator comprises an analyzer that analyzes timing events to determine timing information, which specifies the timing event for the program.

The timing information may be used by any such timing apparatus, such as a time base to generate the timing signal.
(actual abstract) When compiling high-level, graphical code (e.g. LabVIEW&#x2122; code) to a different representation (e.g. different software code or hardware FPGA), information relating to characteristics of the design may be collected/captured from the compilation process, and automatically provided to all the earlier stages of the compilation process to obtain more optimal results. Without automated feedback of this information, users have to manually identify, produce, and provide the feedback information, or forego the process altogether, having to assume that the tool has produced the best possible results when that may not be the case. To correct timing, failed constraints paths may be parsed and compared to delays obtained during a previous compile, and previous adjustments that didn't yield desired results may be undone. The longest delay that didn't result from an undone path may then be identified, and adjusted, and the process may be repeated until all paths are predicted to pass.

The cross-node quantum interaction can be produced by non-commutivity of the intra-node quantum couplings and the inter-node quantum couplings. In some instances, the qubits can be manipulated by applying a control sequence that produces an interaction frame where the cross-node quantum interaction dominates the time evolution of the system.

(predicted abstract) The present invention pertains to an actuator element for a hydraulic cylinder with a fixed piston ring, such as a slide valve, which is movable to and fro in the cylinder bore. The actuator element can be designed as a rod-like or circular body and is provided on the outer surface by at least one annular groove that faces toward the outer surface. For this purpose, the annular groove comprises a series of helical grooves with different helix angles and the diameter of the annular groove is at least two times the total diameter of the piston ring. The annular groove is designed to be radially offset by at least one circumferential step. At least one ring groove (A) is provided which acts as guide means for a guide pin (S) that extends axially to the rod-like body. The annular groove, on the other hand, has a substantially constant diameter.
(actual abstract) Embodiments described herein may take the form of an electromagnetic actuator that produces a haptic output during operation. Generally, an electromagnetic coil is wrapped around a central magnet array. A shaft passes through the central magnet array, such that the central array may move along the shaft when the proper force is applied. When a current passes through the electromagnetic coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. The coil is stationary with respect to a housing of the actuator, while the central magnet array may move along the shaft within the housing. Thus, excitation of the coil exerts a force on the central magnet array, which moves in response to that force. The direction of the current through the coil determines the direction of the magnetic field and thus the motion of the central magnet array.

(predicted abstract) A method, as a light distribution control (LCD) system, can control a load provided to a light source at a headlight without using auxiliary components and without using additional components and without an external supply of electric power. The LCD system can include a light source comprising a plurality of light sources and an ac current controller configured to control a level of each of a plurality of current source voltage sets, where the levels are determined based on a light level distribution based on each light source.
(actual abstract) Speed of a vehicle is acquired from a speed detecting device, and then a beam switching threshold, according to the acquired speed, of an irradiation direction of a headlight is initially set. When the number of appearance (i.e. frequency of appearance) of a light source in a predetermined time detected by a light source detection means have become the beam switching threshold or more, the headlight is switched to a low beam. When a predetermined time (beam switching prohibition time Tp) has been passed after the irradiation direction of a headlight was switched to the low beam, the irradiation direction of the headlight is switched to a high beam.
