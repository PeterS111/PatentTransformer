(predicted abstract) Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards techniques and configurations for decoding and/or decoding quantized transform domain transform block. In particular, a video decoder may be configured to generate intra prediction mode information for a luma component of a chroma component of an image and for an intra prediction mode for the chroma component of the image, and generate intra prediction mode information for an luma component of the chroma component of the image based on one or more particular intra prediction modes. If the particular intra prediction modes are equal to the intra prediction mode for the chroma component of the image, then the video decoder reconfigures an intra prediction mode of the chroma component, for example, the chroma component may be configured to match the intra prediction mode for the luma component with the luma component of the image. Other embodiments may be described and/or claimed.
(actual abstract) Intra prediction is used in state-of-the-art video coding standards such as AVC. The intra prediction modes are coded into the bitstream. Luma and chroma components could potentially have different prediction modes. For chroma components, there are 7 different modes defined in AVC: vertical, horizontal, DC, diagonal directions, and &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d;. Statistics show that the &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d; mode is frequently used, but in AVC, this mode is encoded using more bits than other modes during entropy coding, therefore the coding efficiency is decreased. Accordingly, a modified binarization/codeword assignment for chroma intra mode signaling is able to be utilized for high efficiency video coding (HEVC), the next generation video coding standard.

The slider may be adjusted along a radial direction and the radial direction may be changed by an actuator in response to a position error. The servo tracks may be configured to have different radial positions.
(actual abstract) A two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) disk drive has a disk with servo tracks with a track pitch that varies across the radius of the disk. The servo track pitch (STP) is related to the cross-track spacing (CTS) of the multiple read sensors in the TDMR head structure. The CTS is given by the equation: CTS=(CTO)cos &#x3b8;+(ATO)sin &#x3b8;, where &#x3b8; is the skew angle, and CTO is the cross-track spacing and ATO the along-the-track spacing of the read sensors at zero skew angle. The optimal variable STP profile results in track misregistration reduction because it allows each read sensor to read a different servo half-track and thus noise sources not correlated to noise sources read by the other read sensors. The servo tracks may be arranged into a plurality of annular bands, with the STP in each band being fixed and different from the STP in the other bands.

(predicted abstract) Systems and methods to predict risk of unauthorized data transfer, including detecting an unauthorized data transfer by detecting a potential data read access by a client using a number of threshold threshold values; wherein detecting the potential data read access includes detecting, via a processor, an attempt to transfer data to a server; and based on the attempt to transfer the data to the server and an analysis of the potential data.
(actual abstract) In response to a local Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) agent identifying a potential data exfiltration attack, the binary identified in the attack is sent to a static analysis tool for further analysis. The agent also identifies a source and a sink involved in the potential data exfiltration. The static analysis tool decompiles the binary, and then runs the de-compiled code through a static analysis to identify data flows between the source and the sink, e.g., a data flow from the source that is the method used to read sensitive information, and a data flow to the sink that is the method used to write to the remote system. If there are such data flows, the activity reported by the agent is likely a true exfiltration attack. Based on this flow determination, the static analysis tool returns a response to the agent validating that the activity is an attack.

(actual abstract) Myelodysplastic syndromes display both hematological and biological heterogeneity with variable leukemia potential. To determine whether microRNAs expression offers diagnostic discrimination or influences malignant potential in MDS, bone marrow miRNA expression was investigated from prognostically distinct MDS subsets using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization, data were analyzed indicating thirteen miRNA signature with statistically significant differential expression, including down-regulation of members of a leukemia associated miRNA family. A unique signature consisting of 10 miRNAs was closely associated with International Prognostic Scoring System risk category permitting discrimination between lower and higher risk disease. Selective overexpression of miRNA-181 family members was detected in higher risk MDS, indicating pathogenetic overlap with acute myeloid leukemia. Analysis of miRNA expression profile offers diagnostic utility, and provides pathogenetic and prognostic discimination in MDS.

(predicted abstract) A method for auto-calibration of stereo cameras detects the location of objects of interest within a scene, extracts feature-free candidate points of interest from previously captured images, generates a disparity map for each candidate point on each image, and then computes a distance metric from each candidate point to the nearest candidate point. A disparity map is stored with the estimated disparity of the nearest candidate point. These distances are compared with the distance metrics to compute distance metrics for each point in the scene. The closest candidate point is selected as the location of the nearest candidate point for which the distance metric for the nearest candidate point is closest to an estimated disparity of the closest candidate point. This approach can be applied to any type of camera, so that the calibration technique results in one image at a higher resolution before the images are images.

(predicted abstract) A system and method for managing a group of cards, the system including a user interface configured to enable a user to define a time-sliced bundle of cards in the group of cards in a defined order, and at least one processor configured to generate a time-sliced bundle of cards,
(actual abstract) Methods, apparatus, and computer-readable media are described herein related to a user interface (UI) for a computing device, such as head-mountable device (HMD). The UI allows a user of the HMD to navigate through a timeline of ordered screens or cards shown on the graphic display of the HMD. The cards on the timeline may be chronologically ordered based on times associated with each card. Numerous cards may be added to the timeline such that a user may scroll through the timeline to search for a specific card. The HMD may be configured to group cards on the timeline. The cards may be grouped by multiple time periods and by various content types within each respective time period. The cards may also be grouped based on durations between the present/on-going time period and each respective time period.

The arc flash protection system evaluates this current status signal along with a light status signal indicating whether light characteristic of an arc event has been detected. Based on this evaluation, the arc flash protection system sends a control signal to the trip system for controlling the trip system to trip a breaker. The systems each include a full-duplex signaling module for sending the signals between the systems over a pair of conductors. Each signaling module sends one of the signals by modulating the magnitude of a current through or a voltage across the conductors, and receives the other signal by demodulating the magnitude of the current through or the voltage across the conductors, as distinctively modulated by the other signaling module.

The selector delivers an electric potential at a node of a dividing resistor selected by the zap circuit. The output of the selector is delivered to the non-inverting input of an operational amplifier, and the output of the operational amplifier is delivered to the gate terminal of a MOSFET. The operational amplifier controls the gate of the MOSFET so that the potential at a current detecting resistor equals the output of the selector. As a result, a current proportional to the input voltage flows through the MOSFET.

(actual abstract) A method for fabricating custom surface reflectance and spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BDRFs or svBRDFs). The 3D printing method optimizes micro-geometry to produce a normal distribution function (NDF) that can be printed on surfaces with a 3D printer. Particularly, the method involves optimizing the micro-geometry for a wide range of analytic NDFs and simulating the effective reflectance of the resulting surface. Using the results of the simulation, the appearance of an input svBRDF can be reproduced. To this end, the micro-geometry is optimized in a data-driven fashion and distributed on the surface of the printed object. The methods were demonstrated to allow 3D printing svBRDF on planar samples with current 3D printing technology even with a limited set of printing materials, and the described methods have been shown to be naturally extendable to printing svBRDF on arbitrary shapes or 3D objects.

(actual abstract) A system which includes a turbo bypass switching valve (BSV) positioned at a beneficial location as a direct mount on an air box to achieve compliance to OBD hose-off requirement via electronic actuation of the BSV and monitoring of the fuel tank pressure sensor for pressure change. When the turbocharger unit is generating pressurized air, the turbo BSV is open, and vapor is passing through the purge valve, some level of vacuum in the fuel tank is sensed. By closing the BSV, flow through the venturi is reduced, producing both less vacuum and a change in fuel tank pressure. The pressure change does not occur if any of the hoses become disconnected. This results in a simple OBD &#x201c;venture hose off&#x201d; check without additional components.
