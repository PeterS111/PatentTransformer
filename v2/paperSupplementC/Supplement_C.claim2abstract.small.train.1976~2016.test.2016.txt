(predicted abstract) An arrow and bow toy of the type having an arced body with a mid-portion where the bow is separated from the body, and having a tail at the upper end of the body. A plurality of fins protrude from the shaft at the rear of the arrow shaft, and a forward slanting slot formed within the shaft. A spring biased nose engageable into the slot, is normally urged to a forward position, but urged to a rearward position. The bow is then pushed downwardly from the rear of the arrow shaft and then rotated upwardly about the mid-portion to an arrow tail. The bow and arrow tail are then drawn back by the bow forward so that the bow and arrow tail remain in the same angular alignment of each other, the bow tail and arrow shaft being released from the arrow tail, allowing the bow tail to freely rotate, thereby causing the bow to be launched from the bow and arrow shaft. A spring biased arrow body is then pulled back by the bow, which is then pushed forward to the forward end of the arrow, thereby increasing the forward force applied by the bow tail to the arrow and arrow shaft and increasing the forward forces applied by the bow to the arrow.
(actual abstract) A bow and arrow toy having a light-weight, foam tipped arrow and a bow with rear and fore tension bands. To load and arm the toy, the rear of the arrow is abutted against the rear tension band and the shaft of the arrow is pressed against the fore tension band and drawn back. As the arrow is drawn back, the shaft of the arrow slides against the fore tension band until the fore tension band falls into an engagement slot along the shaft, causing the fore tension band to also become engaged and tensioned as the arrow is drawn back further. At the fore outside edge of the engagement slot is a catch lip which protrudes outwards from the shaft and functions to guide the fore tension band into the engagement slot if the pressure of the shaft against the fore tension band is not sufficient to cause the fore tension band to slide directly into the engagement slot. The fore tension band is comprised of three interlinked loops, with the central loop being sleeved so as to narrow its effective diameter. The front profile of the fore tension band, from top to bottom, slants rearward, is vertical and slants forward, thereby providing physical guidance for proper horizontal orientation of the arrow. The sleeved central loop differs in color from the top and bottom loops of the fore tension band to facilitate proper horizontal orientation of the arrow.

(actual abstract) Intra prediction is used in state-of-the-art video coding standards such as AVC. The intra prediction modes are coded into the bitstream. Luma and chroma components could potentially have different prediction modes. For chroma components, there are 7 different modes defined in AVC: vertical, horizontal, DC, diagonal directions, and &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d;. Statistics show that the &#x201c;same as luma&#x201d; mode is frequently used, but in AVC, this mode is encoded using more bits than other modes during entropy coding, therefore the coding efficiency is decreased. Accordingly, a modified binarization/codeword assignment for chroma intra mode signaling is able to be utilized for high efficiency video coding (HEVC), the next generation video coding standard.

Each user belongs to one or more user groups and each information resource belongs to one or more information sets. Access is permitted or denied according to access policies which define access in terms of the user groups and information sets. The first access filter in the path performs the access check, encrypts and authenticates the request; the other access filters in the path do not repeat the access check. The interface used by applications to determine whether a user has access to an entity is now an SQL entity. The policy server assembles the information needed for the response to the query from various information sources, including source external to the policy server.

(predicted abstract) A two-dimensional, optical magnetic recording-disk drive (10) is provided that comprises a magnetic recording disk (12) with a plurality of radial servo tracks (24 and 26). The number of servo sectors (30 and 40) in each track may be selected from among multiple, spaced servo sectors (32); the angle of the transverse cross-track to the radial distance of each servo sector being less than the radius of the track for each servo sector. The servo sectors comprise spaced parallel tracks (36 and 38, 38 and 38&#x2032;), and each track has an axial position (38&#x2032;, 38&#x2033;) defined by the radial position of the servo sector along the track.
(actual abstract) A two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) disk drive has a disk with servo tracks with a track pitch that varies across the radius of the disk. The servo track pitch (STP) is related to the cross-track spacing (CTS) of the multiple read sensors in the TDMR head structure. The CTS is given by the equation: CTS=(CTO)cos &#x3b8;+(ATO)sin &#x3b8;, where &#x3b8; is the skew angle, and CTO is the cross-track spacing and ATO the along-the-track spacing of the read sensors at zero skew angle. The optimal variable STP profile results in track misregistration reduction because it allows each read sensor to read a different servo half-track and thus noise sources not correlated to noise sources read by the other read sensors. The servo tracks may be arranged into a plurality of annular bands, with the STP in each band being fixed and different from the STP in the other bands.

(predicted abstract) In accordance with the present invention, a method to predict risk of unauthorized data transfer using an advanced risk assessment (ACAS) technique is described. The method comprises receiving a data set including an executable, together with an indication of a source, and a sink. The method further includes converting the executable into de-compiled code by performing a taint analysis against the de-compiled code to determine whether one or more data flows between the source and the sink are indicative of a write to the target being related to a read of sensitive information. Based on the determination, an analysis assessment is made.
(actual abstract) In response to a local Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) agent identifying a potential data exfiltration attack, the binary identified in the attack is sent to a static analysis tool for further analysis. The agent also identifies a source and a sink involved in the potential data exfiltration. The static analysis tool decompiles the binary, and then runs the de-compiled code through a static analysis to identify data flows between the source and the sink, e.g., a data flow from the source that is the method used to read sensitive information, and a data flow to the sink that is the method used to write to the remote system. If there are such data flows, the activity reported by the agent is likely a true exfiltration attack. Based on this flow determination, the static analysis tool returns a response to the agent validating that the activity is an attack.

(actual abstract) Myelodysplastic syndromes display both hematological and biological heterogeneity with variable leukemia potential. To determine whether microRNAs expression offers diagnostic discrimination or influences malignant potential in MDS, bone marrow miRNA expression was investigated from prognostically distinct MDS subsets using a microarray platform. After background subtraction and normalization, data were analyzed indicating thirteen miRNA signature with statistically significant differential expression, including down-regulation of members of a leukemia associated miRNA family. A unique signature consisting of 10 miRNAs was closely associated with International Prognostic Scoring System risk category permitting discrimination between lower and higher risk disease. Selective overexpression of miRNA-181 family members was detected in higher risk MDS, indicating pathogenetic overlap with acute myeloid leukemia.

(predicted abstract) Data access techniques are described herein as well as embodiments thereof. At least some embodiments include systems and methods that facilitate data access across multiple virtual machines. In one embodiment, a virtual machine template is created that includes a description of a physical machine. A copy of the physical machine file is stored locally on the virtual machine template in an association with the file. The virtual machine template is monitored for a file access operation based on an error that occurred in the virtual machine template. Further, a hash is generated and stored locally on the virtual machine template that is unique to the virtual machine template. The hash is compared to the hash to determine whether an error occurred, or that a copy of the file does not exist on the virtual machine template. If an error occurred the copy is stored locally on the virtual machine template. If an error occurred the copy is not stored locally on the virtual machine template.
(actual abstract) A virtual machine template is created. The template includes a file system containing files to be deduplicated across multiple virtual machines. For each file to deduplicate, a hash of the content is generated and stored in association with the file. The content of the file is moved from the virtual machine template to a file store. The entry for the file in the store is indexed according to the hash. Multiple virtual machines are created by cloning the template, each containing a copy of its file system and the hashes stored locally in association with the corresponding deduplicated files. File access operations are monitored on each one of the multiple virtual machines, and attempts to access deduplicated file are detected. In response, the corresponding locally stored hash is used to retrieve the content of the file from the central file store, and provide it to the virtual machine.

(actual abstract) A method for fabricating custom surface reflectance and spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BDRFs or svBRDFs). The 3D printing method optimizes micro-geometry to produce a normal distribution function (NDF) that can be printed on surfaces with a 3D printer. Particularly, the method involves optimizing the micro-geometry for a wide range of analytic NDFs and simulating the effective reflectance of the resulting surface. Using the results of the simulation, the appearance of an input svBRDF can be reproduced. To this end, the micro-geometry is optimized in a data-driven fashion and distributed on the surface of the printed object.

(predicted abstract) In a manufacturing method of a laser working apparatus, a laser light source emits a laser, a reflection spatial light modulator modulates the laser light emitted from the laser light source, a converging optical system converges the laser light modulated by the reflection spatial light modulator, while holding a plate-shaped object of which an edge becomes a starting point and cutting an interior of the object along a line. When the plate-shaped object is cut along the line to form a modified region, a controller controls the reflection spatial light modulator, and irradiates the plate-shaped object with the laser light reflected by a reflection surface of the reflection spatial light modulator to form the modified region on the plate-shaped object.
(actual abstract) An object is irradiated with a laser light modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that aberration of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined aberration or less. Therefore, aberration of the laser light generated at a position on which a converging point of the laser light is located is made as small as possible, to enhance the energy density of the laser light at that position, which makes it possible to form a modified region with a high function as a starting point for cutting. In addition, because the reflection type spatial light modulator is used, it is possible to improve the utilization efficiency of the laser light as compared with a transmissive type spatial light modulator.

(predicted abstract) The present invention is a method and apparatus for the reliable switching of synchronisation messages in a distributed computer system by receiving from a transmitting node a message received from a transmitting node. The message is modified by an AUS and a TIC field is calculated using at least one of the SIBs. The calculated TIC is then modified by the AUS and an associated TIC field. The transmission of the modified message is interrupted upon determining that a positive difference value is less than a threshold value. In this manner, the method may be applied to the transmission of asynchronous messages through multiple nodes that are connected using a single network interface. The present invention may be used as a master for synchronization in a distributed computer system.
