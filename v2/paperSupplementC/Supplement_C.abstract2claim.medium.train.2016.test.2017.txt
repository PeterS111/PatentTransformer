(actual claim) A method for secure electronic mail delivery comprising: <|span|> receiving, at a message delivery server, a message for delivery to a receiving computer; <|span|> determining, by the message delivery server, whether the message is one of an encrypted real message and an encrypted phantom message; and <|span|> discarding, by the message delivery server, the message in response to determining that the message is an encrypted phantom message.
(abstract)
A network is disclosed that includes a message originator computer and a message recipient computer, for secure electronic mail delivery. In accordance with the invention, the network includes a message delivery server that can distinguish between real and phantom messages. In operation, the message originator computer waits a random time and then transmits a first encrypted phantom message to the message delivery server. This message is to spoof an eavesdropper into believing that there is a steady stream of messages being sent from the originator computer. However, the message delivery server recognizes the message as a phantom message and discards it. When the message originator computer receives a user request to transmit a real message to the recipient computer, it waits a random time and then encrypts and transmits the real message to the message delivery server. The message delivery server recognizes the message as a real message and forwards the real message to the recipient computer. Meanwhile, the message originator computer can continue transmitting encrypted phantom messages to the message delivery server. In this manner, an eavesdropper will be tricked into believing that there is a steady stream of messages being sent from the originator computer.

(abstract)
Techniques are described herein for automatically selecting the compression techniques to be used on tabular data. A compression analyzer gives users high-level control over the selection process without requiring the user to know details about the specific compression techniques that are available to the compression analyzer. Users are able to specify, for a given set of data, a &#x201c;balance point&#x201d; along the spectrum between &#x201c;maximum performance&#x201d; and &#x201c;maximum compression&#x201d;. The point thus selected is used by the compression analyzer in a variety of ways. For example, in one embodiment, the compression analyzer uses the user-specified balance point to determine which of the available compression techniques qualify as &#x201c;candidate techniques&#x201d; for the given set of data. The compression analyzer selects the compression technique to use on a set of data by actually testing the candidate compression techniques against samples from the set of data. After testing the candidate compression techniques against the samples, the resulting compression ratios are compared. The compression technique to use on the set of data is then selected based, in part, on the compression ratios achieved during the compression tests performed on the sample data.

(abstract)
An RF PA is designed to operate efficiently for average powers when biased at the system supply voltage, and uses an envelope tracking power supply to boost the bias voltage to maintain good efficiency at higher powers. As a result, for a majority of the time when transmitting average power signals, the RF PA bias voltage is the system-wide supply voltage (e.g. 3.4V in cell phones), which eliminates the need for stepping down voltages. The bias voltage is boosted during the less frequent times when higher power is needed. As a result, only a boost type of DC voltage converter is needed. The efficiency of the RF PA is therefore increased because voltage conversion is required less frequently and only when higher power RF signals are transmitted.

(abstract)
An electromagnetic transducer for sound and ultrasound reproduction includes a substantially flat coil coupled to a diaphragm that is near to and facing the North or South side of a magnet. A very thin membrane made from a non-magnetic but electrically conductive material is independently mounted from the diaphragm and faces it. An AC signal in the coil results in diaphragm movement and &#x201c;modulates&#x201d; the permanent magnetic field. The modulating field generates a current in the membrane, which, upon further interactions, causes the membrane to move. The two independently moving surfaces each generate sound and result in an unusually flat SPL/frequency response, with unusually low narrow-band intensity variation and very low distortion. The transducer is also unique among electromagnetic transducers in that the force acting on the membrane is uniformly distributed over much of it, as in an electrostatic sound transducer.

(abstract)
System and method for restricting output power from multiple serially coupled DC power sources, such as a solar cell array, controlled by power balancing circuitry, thereby enabling power restriction in the event of an emergency. Output bypass circuitry allows the output voltage to be selectively restricted, and though power for switching between states would be needed, use of bi-stable bypass circuitry would avoid a need for power to remain in a state of bypass operation. Additionally, with the serially coupled DC power sources controlled by power balancing circuitry, use of solid-state current switching elements ensures continued output power restriction due to the clamping action of the body diodes upon the output voltage.

(abstract)
The application relates to a hearing device comprising a beamformer of the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) type. The application further relates to a method of operating a hearing device. The disclosure addresses a problem which occurs when using a GSC structure in a hearing device application. The problem arises due to a non-ideal target-cancelling beamformer. As a consequence, a target signal impinging from the look direction can&#x2014;unintentionally&#x2014;be attenuated by as much as 30 dB. To resolve this problem, it is proposed to monitor the difference between the output signals from the all-pass beamformer and the target-cancelling beamformer to control a time-varying regularization parameter in the GSC update. This has the advantage of providing a computationally simple solution to the non-ideality of the GSC beamformer. The invention may e.g. be used in hearing aids, headsets, ear phones, active ear protection systems, or combinations thereof.

Existing algorithms to build balanced tree structures (&#x201c;b-trees&#x201d;) compare a data element (e.g., a key) to be inserted with the data elements that have already been inserted to find the correct position to insert the data element. Additionally, the algorithms balance and/or rebalance the b-tree when any individual node gets over-filled. As part of this balancing, data elements stored in the various nodes are moved to other nodes. These operations can incur both time and resource costs. We propose an algorithm to build a b-tree in a bottom up manner and a technique to modify trees built using the aforementioned algorithm so that they are balanced. We also propose a method to allow for adding more data into the thus-built b-tree as long as it follows a certain set of pre-conditions.

(abstract)
The timing analysis of an integrated chip component using dynamic load sensitive timing feedback constraints maintaining the timing accuracy for all the boundary paths is achieved by capturing a reduced order representation for parasitic load within a component for each of its primary input and primary output along with sensitivities of the arrival time, the slew and the required arrival time to the load representation at the component parent level of hierarchy as part of generating load sensitive feedback constraints. During the out-of-context timing closure of the component, the base load representation and the sensitivities, and an updated load representation enables the calculation of the updated boundary constraint for an accurate timing analysis. The accuracy improvement increases a chip designer productivity during timing closure resulting in a shortened time to take the chip design through timing closure to manufacturing. The method is applicable for deterministic as well as for statistical timing analyses.
