(actual abstract) A rotatable vertical growing system enhances circulation between a hydroponic network and an aquaponic network in a closed fluid circulation. The networks are interdependent and operate on a constant body of growth fluid that continuously circulates between an aquaponic vessel and a hydroponic growing container. A rotational energy and a direct pressure generated by an external fluid serve to increase the flow rate of the growth fluid during circulation. A rotatable base portion floats concentrically in the aquaponic vessel. The base portion includes a gear system that enables rotation. Protruding members extend from the rotating base portion to agitate and guide the growth fluid through the circulatory path. The external fluid discharges into the vessel to aerate the fluid, increase the flow rate of the growth fluid, and actuate the gear system. The hydroponic growing container rotates to provide uniform access to light for the plants.

(actual abstract) A method and apparatus for reconfiguring hardware structures to pipeline the execution of multiple special purpose hardware implemented functions, without saving intermediate results to memory, is provided. Pipelining functions in a program is typically performed by a first function saving its results (the &#x201c;intermediate results&#x201d;) to memory, and a second function subsequently accessing the memory to use the intermediate results as input. Saving and accessing intermediate results stored in memory incurs a heavy performance penalty, requires more power, consumes more memory bandwidth, and increases the memory footprint. Due to the ability to redirect the input and output of the hardware structures, intermediate results are passed directly from one special purpose hardware implemented function to another without storing the intermediate results in memory. Consequently, a program that utilizes the method or apparatus, reduces power consumption, consumes less memory bandwidth, and reduces the program's memory footprint.

(actual abstract) Present invention provides a high-precision pressure sampling head used in a Pitot tube flow sensor. The pressure sampling head includes a cylindrical pressure sampling head body. The cylindrical pressure sampling head body contains a total pressure channel and a static pressure channel. The axis of the total pressure channel and the axis of the static pressure channel are parallel to the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Two inclined surfaces are formed on two opposite sides of the lower end of the cylindrical pressure sampling body. A first inclined surface intersects with the total pressure channel and thus a total pressure sensing hole is formed on the first inclined surface. A second inclined surface intersects with the static pressure channel and thus a static pressure sensing hole is formed on the second inclined surface. An angle &#x3b1; formed between the first inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body is smaller than the angle &#x3b2; formed between the second inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Based on experimental results, when measuring the volume flow rate of a liquid in a pipe or conduit using the pressure sampling head according to the present invention, the fluid can flow stably through the pressure sampling head, with a high differential pressure between the total pressure sensing hole and the static pressure sensing hole. Thus, a pressure differential measuring device can more easily collect the data and achieve a higher precision of measurement. The measurement precision class can reach between 0.2-0.5.

(actual abstract) Enhanced message passing architectures and libraries include an interruptible wait feature. After a thread X calls a completion-awaiting routine of a message passing interface library, a progress engine executes while the routine is in the blocked condition. A thread Y interrupts the routine before all messaging operations are completed. The interrupted routine returns control to thread X with an indication that the routine's completion condition is unsatisfied. The completion-awaiting routine may have the same function signature as a standard MPI routine. In some cases, thread Y interrupts the routine while requesting a lock held by thread X. In some applications, thread X is a communication thread and thread Y is one of multiple worker threads. The interruptible wait feature may be joined by an asynchronous callback feature, which associates a callback with a deterministic execution context.

(actual abstract) Techniques disclosed herein include increasing pattern density for creating high-resolution contact openings, slots, trenches, and other features. A conformal spacer is applied on a bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel (multi-layer) or other relief feature. The conformal spacer thus wraps around the mandrels and is also deposited on an underlying layer. A fill material is deposited to fill gaps or spaces between sidewall spacers. A CMP planarization step then removes substrate stack material down to a material interface of the bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel, with a middle or lower material of the mandrel being a CMP-stop material. This technique essentially cuts off or removes rounded features such as upper portions of sidewall spacers, thereby providing a spacer material with a planar top surface that can be uniformly etched and transferred to underlying layers.

(predicted abstract) Disclosed are methods for preparing epoxy-clay nanocomposite using either a high conversion of glycine to 1,4-propanediol or a high conversion of 1,4-butanediol to aldehyde via a reaction performed at a solution temperature from 60&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. in an organic solvent, aqueous solution, or both. Disclosed also are compositions and epoxy-clay nanocomposite prepared using such methods or methods. Also disclosed are uses of the epoxy-clay nanocomposite.
(actual abstract) The method for the preparation of epoxy-clay nanocomposites uses high shear mixing of Nanomer I.30 E nanoclay into the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy by optimization of high shear mixing speeds, mixing times and degassing temperature. The results showed that the optimum high shear mixing speed and mixing time for optimal clay dispersion were 6000 rpm and 60 min, respectively. Increasing the degassing temperature from 65&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. for the first two hours of the degassing process enhanced nanoclay dispersion, resulting in nanocomposites with a morphology dominated by disorder intercalation with some exfoliated structure. This enhancement in nanocomposite morphology can be attributed to the improvement in epoxy diffusion into the intergallery spacing between clay layers due to temperature rise.

(predicted abstract) Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to methods and systems for enhancing images. The images may be enhanced by applying a non-linear (e.g., Gaussian) mapping to the image, such that an enhancement layer may take on the mapping. The mapping may be configured to improve the quality of the image, for example, by applying an anti-aliasing filter to the image. By altering the appearance of the enhancement layer, different amounts of enhancement layers may be applied to the image (e.g., depending on their relative locations) and may be selectively applied to the resulting image so that the enhancement layer can be removed from the resulting image. Once the enhancement layer has been removed from the resulting image, the resulting image may be enhanced by applying, for example, a low-pass filter, a high-pass filter, or an adaptive filter.

(predicted abstract) A method for determining a position characteristic for an object in a detection area of an opto-electronic system with a sensor has a step of generating an optical field by applying an external beam from a plurality of incident light sources having differing substantially the same optical path length. In order to determine the position characteristic a spatial distribution of the intensity of one of the groups of incident light sources has a long section, by determining the spatial distribution of intensity values of the group, of a spatially resolved distribution of the intensity values, in which each intensity value corresponds to a different wavelength. This results in the absolute position of a position characteristic of the object in a detection area that is to be determined.

(actual abstract) This invention involves a method of securing pipe (also referred to as a &#x201c;string of tools&#x201d;) when driving off a subsea well or sealing off a well in onshore applications where there is an emergency by grabbing the pipe before it is cut. A pipe ram then is closed on the pipe before a shear ram is actuated to cut the pipe. In subsea applications, the top of the pipe may then be raised clear of the blowout preventer within a marine riser. A blind ram and annular preventer can then be closed above the remnant of the pipe being retained by the pipe catcher. The pipe above the cut is removed through the marine riser and the marine riser itself is then disconnected. The rig is then driven off the well. If the well is reactivated the steps are reversed but the well is safely secured before the blowout preventer components are opened. The pipe supported by the catcher is independently supported before the catcher is released and the pipe lifted through the riser.

When an intensity of the trigger current is larger than a threshold value, the active protection circuit controls the I/O circuit to provide a sink or compensation current so as to neutralize the bulk current and to reduce the net current flowing into or sourced from the core circuit, thereby increasing the latch-up resistance and immunity of the core circuit.

(predicted abstract) A method of recognizing an object in an image includes detecting edges of the object in the image and generating an edge image vector by detecting at least one edge of the object in the image such that vectors of consecutive pixels of an image are each assigned a pixel value. The image is divided into a plurality of regions, and gradient vectors are automatically identified which represent the gradient in target vectors and the gradient vectors between the regions. The method is executed for recognizing an object in an image by, for each region and for each time interval of a plurality of time intervals: comparing the gradient vectors for the region with a predetermined threshold value and identifying if the gradient vectors are approximately equal to the predetermined threshold value at the respective time interval; and analyzing the identified gradient vectors for the region to recognize the object in the image, only if that gradient vector is identified that is approximately equal to the predetermined threshold value.
(actual abstract) Various embodiments enable a primary user to be identified and tracked using stereo association and multiple tracking algorithms. For example, a face detection algorithm can be run on each image captured by a respective camera independently. Stereo association can be performed to match faces between cameras. If the faces are matched and a primary user is determined, a face pair is created and used as the first data point in memory for initializing object tracking. Further, features of a user's face can be extracted and the change in position of these features between images can determine what tracking method will be used for that particular frame.

(actual abstract) A pressure compensation system for enclosed spaces at a subterranean location changes volume with thermally induced solubility changes of a salt in water. The salt is held in an enclosure that is either rigid, or impervious and flexible or porous and flexible. As well conditions change and temperature increases, some of the salt goes into solution with a resulting decrease in volume that compensates for thermally induced volume increase due to temperature increase in the borehole. Conversely, a decrease in borehole temperature brings some of the salt out of solution for a volume increase to offset the volume decrease of the adjacent fluid to keep the pressure stabilized in the enclosed volume. In the porous enclosure embodiment the openings are sufficiently small to retain the salt even in solution. However, minimal net flows are anticipated for pressure compensation due to changing thermal effects.

(predicted abstract) A method, computer program product, and system for implementing frame alignment in a Fibre Channel network. A frame alignment is implemented for frame alignment operating as part of a Fibre Channel frame sequence. A Fibre Channel frame is received, the Fibre Channel frame being transmitted from a first node. An effective channel value is determined for the frame alignment based on the received frame. A Fibre Channel frame is transmitted from the first node responsive to the determined effective channel value for the frame alignment, the Ethernet frame being transmitted from a second node to the second node. The frame alignment is implemented based on the frame and the determined effective channel value. The frame alignment is implemented without any overhead based on the Ethernet frame. A Fibre Channel frame of a set of fibroids maintained in the Fibre Channel frame sequence is transmitted from the first node to the second node. The frame alignment can be achieved without overhead by re-transmitting the frame from the second node to the first node.
(actual abstract) A switch unit has one frame buffer pool for storing received frames and another frame buffer pool for storing large frames. The frame size in the large frame buffer pool may be optimized to the largest amount of data the switch unit that an FCoE switching is running on can support (i.e., a limitation of zone entries). Should free space be unavailable in the large frame buffer pool, or if a sequence grows bigger than can be supported, the switch unit may still continue to send response frames back to the sender. While the switch unit may store header information of the frame, the switch unit does not store the data of subsequent frames any longer. Once the sequence has been received completely, a rejection message is sent back with an appropriate error or reason code. The rejection message enables the sender to attempt a retransmission or cancel the current request altogether.

The first result set comprises a first result corresponding to the first input. A ranking score is computed for each result in the first result set, including ranking each result in the first result set based at least in part on the first input and a relevance score for each result in the first result set, including, for at least one result in the first result set, ranking the at least one result in the first result set based on relevance to the first input.
(actual abstract) Techniques described herein enable a service to receive search requests from client systems and perform an integrated search across databases containing informational data for broadcast content and broadband content. The service receives the search request from the client device and formulates a query for at least one broadband database and at least one partner broadcast database. The service queries each broadband database with a compatible query that the service creates using information regarding the type of database queries each partner's database requires. Partners pay the service provider a fee for placing data in the database or for having their database searched by the service. The service formats the data received from the searches of the databases into a user interface screen that is presentable by the client device. The screen information instructs the client device on how it should respond to any key presses by the user.
