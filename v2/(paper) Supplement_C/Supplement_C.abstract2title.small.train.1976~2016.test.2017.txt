(actual title) Determining whether a data storage is encrypted
(abstract)
A method, program and/or system reads first data through a first path from a location in a data storage. Second data is read through a second path from the same location in the data storage. The first data is compared to the second data. A match between the first data and the second data indicates that the first path did not encrypt the first data. A mismatch between the first data and the second data indicates that the first path encrypted the first data.

A measurement object surface is illuminated with a pattern sequence of various patterns using a projector, which is recorded with a camera system, and the 3D coordinates for the measurement points are determined by evaluation of the image sequence. While the image sequence is being recorded translational and/or rotational accelerations of the projector, the camera system and/or the measurement object are measured at least at a measurement rate such that in each case a plurality of values for the accelerations are acquired. It is thus possible, on the basis of the measured accelerations, to take into account algorithmically, when determining the 3D coordinates, movements of the projector, the camera system and/or the measurement object, which movements occur during the illumination times of the respective individual images of the image sequence and provoke unsteadiness and/or motion blur in the respective individual images of the image sequence.

An example method for stabilizing images involves obtaining an image of an environment from a perspective of the robot. The method also involves receiving one or more depth measurements. The depth measurements correspond to locations within the image. The method further involves determining first boundaries around a particular location within a section of the image. The particular location is approximately centered within the first boundaries. Additionally, the method involves determining an extent of deviation of a particular position of the image capture device from a reference position. The particular position is a position of the image capture device at a point in time at which the image was captured. Further, the method involves determining second boundaries by shifting the first boundaries by an amount proportional to the determined extent of deviation. The method additionally involves providing, to a display device, a portion of the image defined by the second boundaries.

(actual title) Constrained interleaving for 5G wireless and optical transport networks
(abstract)
The present invention provides a design framework that is used to develop new types of constrained turbo block convolutional (CTBC) codes that have higher performance than was previously attainable. The design framework is applied to design both random and deterministic constrained interleavers. Vectorizable deterministic constrained interleavers are developed and used to design parallel architectures for real time SISO decoding of CTBC codes. A new signal mapping technique called constrained interleaved coded modulation (CICM) is also developed. CICM is then used to develop rate matching, spatial modulation, and MIMO modulation subsystems to be used with CTBC codes and other types of codes. By way of example, embodiments are primarily provided for improved 5G LTE and optical transport network (OTN) communication systems.

Devices, systems, and methods of detecting whether an electronic device or computerized device or computer, is being controlled by a legitimate human user, or by an automated cyber-attack unit or malware or automatic script. The system monitors interactions performed via one or more input units of the electronic device. The system searches for abnormal input-user interactions; or for an abnormal discrepancy between: the input-unit gestures that were actually registered by the input unit, and the content that the electronic device reports as allegedly entered via such input units. A discrepancy or abnormality indicates that more-possibly a malware or automated script is controlling the electronic device, rather than a legitimate human user. Optionally, an input-output aberration or interference is injected, in order to check for manual corrective actions that only a human user, and not an automated script, is able to perform.

In contrast to the conventional techniques that rely on a single tunable laser for extracting the dispersion parameter at different frequencies, the wide-band optical frequency comb uses multiple comb lines for simultaneously evaluating the dispersion induced phase shifts in different frequencies. Since the frequency response of the dispersive material is a phase function, a phase associated with each comb line passed through the material represents a discrete measure of the material frequency response.

(abstract)
A transmit (TX) signal path circuit in a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver responsive to a digital front end (DFE) for generating receive (RX) path phase alignment signals is disclosed. A digital up-conversion block uses a first numerically-controlled oscillator (NCO) for generating digital intermediate frequency (IF) signals for ordinary TX signal generation, and a different, second NCO for generating digital IF signals for RX phase alignment signal generation. An RF up-conversion block uses a TX local oscillator (LO) for generating analog RF signals for ordinary TX signal generation, and a different feedback (FB) LO for generating analog RF signals for RX phase alignment signal generation. Thus, phase alignment of the circuitry used for ordinary TX signal generation is left undisturbed by RX phase alignment signal generation.

(abstract)
A layer of partially planarized organosilicate (DUO) is spin-coated onto a layer of high density plasma (HDP) oxide on a silicon wafer after the shallow trench isolation (STI) is filled with the HDP oxide. Then the DUO layer is etched using a specialized process specifically tuned to etch the DUO and high density plasma (HDP) oxide at a certain selectivity. The higher areas of the wafer topography (active Si areas) have thinner DUO and as the etch process proceeds it starts to etch through the HDP oxide in these areas (active Si areas). The etch process is stopped after a certain depth is reached and before touching down on the silicon nitride oxidation layer. The DUO is removed and a standard chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) is performed on the silicon wafer. After the CMP step the silicon nitride is removed, exposing the silicon substrate between the field oxides.

(predicted title) High speed encoding of hierarchical information into an N-dimensional representation of common meaning for the concept and a method and system in parallel to a high-level knowledge base (HDB) for the concept
(actual title) Methods and systems of four-valued simulation
(abstract)
A system for the dynamic encoding in a semantic network of both syntactic and semantic information into a common four valued logical notation. The encoding of new information being benign to prior syntactic constructions, tests for N conditionals in time O(C) and allows for the proper quantification of variables at each recursive step. The query/inference engine constructed from such an implementation is able to optimize short term memory for maximizing long term storage in the automaton. In a parallel context this can be viewed as optimizing communication and memory allocation between processes. Disclosed embodiments of a four valued encoding achieve efficiencies in minimizing the run time stack and maximizing heap size especially in a parallel architecture. Disclosed embodiments are useful in simulation and search engine implementations.

(predicted title) Engine variable area fan nozzle structure and method
(actual title) Axially translating and radially tilting fan nozzle segments with combined actuation and position sensing
(abstract)
An aircraft engine variable area fan nozzle structure disposed abaft a thrust reverser, including a sleeve translatable over a cascade array, comprises two semi cylindrical segments that can be axially translated and radially tilted to enlarge the fan duct exhaust area in order to optimize exhaust pressure and associated noise in high thrust circumstances such as on take-off, and to constrict that area under lower thrust conditions such as cruise. The segments are moved by actuators anchored to the fixed engine framework and independently of the thrust reverser translating sleeve. Each actuator incorporates a linear variable differential transformer acting as a fan nozzle position sensor. The tilting movement is imposed by the pivoting links of each segment to carriages that ride in a non-linear trackway secured to a thrust reverser translating sleeve slider. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the thrust reverser sleeve actuator and the variable area fan nozzle actuator are coaxially mounted in a compact assembly anchored to stationary components of the nacelle.

(predicted title) Microwave receiver noise parameter test setup using two wideband directional couplers for merging s- parameter measurement and noise measurement
(actual title) Noise parameter measurement system
(abstract)
A noise parameter test setup allows accurately measuring the four noise parameters (Fmin, Rn, &#x393;opt) of microwave transistors over a wide frequency range using two wideband directional couplers, instead of SPDT switches, to merge the s-parameter (signal) measurement path and the noise measurement path, avoiding thus the uncertainty of the switching repeatability of the SPDT switches and improving the measurement accuracy. Calibration of the system is the same as when using switches. Additional power control precautions of the VNA sources are necessary to avoid injecting large signal power into the sensitive noise receiver during s-parameter measurements and jamming the weak noise power during noise measurement.

(abstract)
A method of electron-beam lithography by direct writing solves the reliability of design of etched components through rounding of the corners of contiguous patterns, notably in patterns to be etched of critical dimension of the order of 35 nm. The method determines critical patterns, and correction patterns by subtracting patterns of corrections of dimensions and of locations as a function of rounding of external or internal corners to be corrected and etching of the corrected design. The corrections may be by a correction model taking account of the parameters of the critical patterns. A correction of the proximity effects specific to these methods is also performed, by resizing of edges of blocks to be etched in combination optimized by the energy latitude with a modulation of the radiated doses. A rescaling and negation functions and eRIF functions may be used to optimize the parameters and the realization of the extrusion.

(abstract)
A current control device sets a target current value of a solenoid, and sets a duty ratio of a PWM signal outputted to a drive circuit of a solenoid based on the target current value. The target current value is a value that periodically varies in a dither period longer than a PWM period of the PWM signal. A setting period of the target current value and a setting period of the duty ratio are shorter than the dither period. As compared with a configuration where the duty ratio is set in the dither period, a time period from a time a basic current value is changed to a time the duty ratio is renewed is shortened. A operation responsiveness of a movable core of the solenoid improves.

Advantageously, the most recent version of data associated with the overlapped logical block address is stored in cache in the non-volatile solid-state device, even when the subsequent disk write operation results in the overlapped logical block address being trimmed from cache or otherwise invalidated. Consequently, data associated with the overlapped logical block address can be accessed more quickly than data written to the magnetic storage device.

(predicted title) Method for treating higher and lower octane fuels
(actual title) Fuel separation system for reducing parasitic losses
(abstract)
Systems and methods for separating higher octane fuel from a fuel mixture are presented. In one example, higher octane fuel is separated from lower octane fuel and allowed to condense in a fuel tank holding higher octane fuel so that parasitic engine losses are not increased by having to separate higher octane fuel from lower octane fuel a second time. The approach may be applied to fuel systems that include multiple fuel tanks storing different types of fuel.

(predicted title) Semiconductor memory device
(actual title) Semiconductor memory device
(abstract)
In a semiconductor memory device storing a resistance difference as information, a long time is taken so as to charge and/or discharge a selected cell by an equalizer circuit, which results in a difficulty of a high speed operation. A selection circuit puts, in a selected state, at least three bit lines which includes a selected bit line connected to a selected memory cell together with unselected bit lines adjacent to the selected bit line on both sides of the selected bit line. The selected and the unselected bit lines are coupled to sense amplifiers through an equalizer circuit. The equalizer circuit puts both the selected and the unselected bit lines into charging states and thereafter puts only the selected bit line into a discharging state to perform a sensing operation. On the other hand, the unselected bit lines are continuously kept at the charging states during the sensing operation. This makes it possible to perform the sensing operation at a high speed with a rare malfunction.

A radiation probe system and method incorporating adaptive gamma radiation background subtraction for enhanced radiation detection capability is disclosed. The system and method are generally applicable to radiation &#x201c;frisking&#x201d; applications in which the contamination area may have high gamma radiation background levels that normally would result in loss of contamination radiation detection accuracy. Readings from a background radiation detector (BRD) are subtracted from a contamination radiation detector (CRD) to determine a count rate solely associated with contamination. A background subtraction factor (BSF) is used to scale the BRD subtraction and is automatically adjusted based on environmental conditions. A smoothing algorithm is used to increase/decrease the BRD and/or CRD acquisition times to account for signal variations in BRD/CRD measurement readings. The system and method provide for lower limit of detection (LLD) radiation levels that are below that of conventional radiation detectors.

(abstract)
The invention is a method for repositioning objects in an automated storage and retrieval system. The method allows objects to move one at a time in an optimally efficient non-revolving sequence, so that often-used storage items can be retrieved more quickly. The method includes arranging positionable objects, such as storage bins or appliances, within a frame with one or more walls. The objects are attached removably to the walls by connectors, such as hooks. One or more planar motion mechanisms, such as H-bots, are mounted on the walls next to the objects. The planar motion mechanisms lift the objects from the connectors to reposition the objects. When a target object is designated, a microcontroller teaches the planar motion mechanisms a sequence for moving the objects into vacant spaces such that the target object can travel to a target access position by the most direct path.

(predicted title) Methods for etching and removing titanium nitride
(actual title) Selective titanium nitride removal
(abstract)
Methods are described herein for selectively etching titanium nitride relative to dielectric films, which may include, for example, alternative metals and metal oxides lacking in titanium and/or silicon-containing films (e.g. silicon oxide, silicon carbon nitride and low-K dielectric films). The methods include a remote plasma etch formed from a chlorine-containing precursor. Plasma effluents from the remote plasma are flowed into a substrate processing region where the plasma effluents react with the titanium nitride. The plasma effluents react with exposed surfaces and selectively remove titanium nitride while very slowly removing the other exposed materials. The substrate processing region may also contain a plasma to facilitate breaking through any titanium oxide layer present on the titanium nitride. The plasma in the substrate processing region may be gently biased relative to the substrate to enhance removal rate of the titanium oxide layer.

(predicted title) induction welding method
(actual title) Enhanced arc control for magnetically impelled butt welding
(abstract)
Tubulars are joined for subterranean borehole use in the production of hydrocarbons by a technique of magnetically impelled arc butt (MIAB) welding. Large casing can be accommodated and the weld quality is maintained with control over the pattern of arc movement on the end walls by virtue of relative movements of the tubulars as the arc is generated and the magnetic field is applied. One or both tubulars can be manipulated relatively in a variety of direction to control the movements of the arc as the magnetic field induces circular arc movement along the end walls of the tubulars to heat up the ends to the temperature needed to effectively fuse the wall ends together. Movement can be rotational or axial about a fixed axis or lateral with respect to the axes both with and without skewing of the axes. The movements can be combined to obtain the desired track.

The machining tool is manufactured such that each of pitches between tool blades of the machining tool is an integer multiple of a pitch between teeth of the gear, the integer multiple being equal to or larger than double. By using the machining tool for cutting performed by the gear machining apparatus, the number of the tool blades of the machining tool, which are brought into contact with the workpiece at the same time, is reduced. Thus, it is possible to suppress occurrence of self-excited vibrations during cutting by reducing the cutting resistance. Thus, it is possible to enhance the tooth trace accuracy of the gear.

(abstract)
To provide a semiconductor device with excellent charge retention characteristics, an OS transistor is used as a transistor whose gate is connected to a node for retaining charge. Charge is stored in a first capacitor, and data at the node for retaining charge is read based on whether the stored charge is transferred to a second capacitor. Since a Si transistor, in which leakage current through a gate insulating film occurs, is not used as a transistor connected to the node for retaining charge, charge retention characteristics of the node are improved. In addition, the semiconductor device operates in data reading without requiring transistor performance equivalent to that of a Si transistor.

(predicted title) Coating for carbide and ceramic
(actual title) Adherent coating on carbide and ceramic substrates
(abstract)
An adherent coating for carbide and ceramic substrates employs a thin layer between the substrate and a subsequent layer or layers. The thin layer may be employed without thermal cracking due to heat during use, such as for the insert of a cutting tool, because the upper layer or layers provide a gradual transition of material properties to a harder, less thermally conductive material on the outermost layer. A particular arrangement of layers on the carbide or ceramic substrate may be, from innermost to outermost layer, hafnium nitride, titanium carbide, aluminum oxide, and titanium nitride.

Disclosed herein are methods and systems for canceling a blocking signal to obtain a desired signal. An example process includes receiving both a blocking signal and a set of blocking bits corresponding to a demodulation of the blocking signal. A remodulated blocking signal is generated by modulating the received set of blocking bits. The remodulated blocking signal is passed through a blocking-band bandpass filter to generate an estimated blocking signal, and is also passed through a desired-band bandpass filter to generate an unconditioned reference signal. One or more signal-parameter differences between the blocking signal and the estimated blocking signal are identified, and one or more signal compensations are accordingly applied to the unconditioned reference signal to generate a conditioned reference signal, which is then output to a blocking-signal-canceling system.

Nucleic acids encoding mutant elongation factor proteins (EF-Sep), phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), and phosphoseryl-tRNA (tRNA<sup>Sep</sup>) and methods of use in site specific incorporation of phosphoserine into a protein or polypeptide are described. Typically, SepRS preferentially aminoacylates tRNA<sup>Sep </sup>with O-phosphoserine and the tRNA<sup>Sep </sup>recognizes at least one codon such as a stop codon. Due to the negative charge of the phosphoserine, Sept-tRNA<sup>Sep </sup>does not bind elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). However, mutant EF-Sep proteins are disclosed that bind Sep-tRNA<sup>Sep </sup>and protect Sep-tRNA<sup>Sep </sup>from deacylation. In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acids are on vectors and are expressed in cells such as bacterial cells, archeaebacterial cells, and eukaryotic cells. Proteins or polypeptides containing phosphoserine produced by the methods described herein can be used for a variety of applications such as research, antibody production, protein array manufacture and development of cell-based screens for new drug discovery.

(predicted title) Toy projectile and launcher system having a spring loaded element
(actual title) Magnus effect cylindrical projectile and launcher
(abstract)
A toy projectile and launcher system. The projectile is tubular in shape and lightweight. The projectile has an exterior surface that is symmetrically disposed about an imaginary longitudinal axis. The launcher has a holding trough that receives and holds the tubular projectile. Within the launcher is a spring loaded element. The spring loaded element selectively moves between a cocked position and a released position. The spring loaded element contacts the projectile in the holding trough as the spring loaded element moves from its cocked position to its released position. Contact with the spring loaded element causes the tubular projectile to launch into flight in a direction perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. Simultaneously, contact with the spring loaded element imparts a spinning rotation to the projectile, wherein the projectile spins about its longitudinal axis in flight. The spinning creates a Magnus effect on the projectile.

(abstract)
The present invention is directed to a system and method which employ two memory access paths: 1) a cache-access path in which block data is fetched from main memory for loading to a cache, and 2) a direct-access path in which individually-addressed data is fetched from main memory. The system may comprise one or more processor cores that utilize the cache-access path for accessing data. The system may further comprise at least one heterogeneous functional unit that is operable to utilize the direct-access path for accessing data. In certain embodiments, the one or more processor cores, cache, and the at least one heterogeneous functional unit may be included on a common semiconductor die (e.g., as part of an integrated circuit). Embodiments of the present invention enable improved system performance by selectively employing the cache-access path for certain instructions while selectively employing the direct-access path for other instructions.

A circuit breaker includes a trip mechanism having reduced trip movement and an integrated signal flag. The trip mechanism includes a spring-biased trip lever and a latching member for keeping the trip lever in an on or latched position. Upon occurrence of an abnormal current condition, the latching member is moved away from the trip lever to trip the trip mechanism. The latching member also has a catch mechanism designed to catch the trip lever after it is released, thereby halting further progress of both the trip lever and the latching member. As a result, less space is needed within the circuit breaker for trip movement compared to existing solutions. Moreover, the location of the catch mechanism on the latching member is selected such that the halting of the latching member places the integrated signal flag in an optimal viewing position within a viewing window.

(predicted title) Data decoding by compressing upper bound data based on lower bound data
(actual title) Folded integer encoding
(abstract)
Techniques of data compression involve performing a separate compression operation on each set of corresponding bits of a sequence of bit strings in which each bit string represents a number having an upper bound. Advantageously, compressing the sets of corresponding bits produces an improved compression ratio over compressing each number in the sequence. Further, decompression is straightforward as long as sequence order is preserved and the upper bound of each number in the sequence is known.

(predicted title) Oil supply system for an internal combustion engine
(actual title) Temperature-controlled segregation of hot and cold oil in a sump of an internal combustion engine
(abstract)
The volume of lubricating oil stored in the sump of an internal combustion engine for a vehicle is in significant excess of the volume of oil circulating through the engine at any one time. The circulating oil, drawn from the sump, may be rapidly heated during its passage through the engine, but the excess volume remaining in the sump dilutes and cools the circulating oil as it returns to the sump. By separating the oil volume into a portion which is circulated through the engine and a second portion which has only limited opportunity to mix with and cool the circulating oil the circulating oil may attain its operating temperature more rapidly. Once the stored volume of oil in the engine has also reached its operating temperature the circulating oil and stored oil may be recombined.

(predicted title) Semiconductor device, control circuit thereof and method for driving thereof
(actual title) Display device
(abstract)
By applying an AC pulse to a gate of a transistor which easily deteriorates, a shift in threshold voltage of the transistor is suppressed. However, in a case where amorphous silicon is used for a semiconductor layer of a transistor, the occurrence of a shift in threshold voltage naturally becomes a problem for a transistor which constitutes a part of circuit that generates an AC pulse. A shift in threshold voltage of a transistor which easily deteriorates and a shift in threshold voltage of a turned-on transistor are suppressed by signal input to a gate electrode of the transistor which easily deteriorates through the turned-on transistor. In other words, a structure for applying an AC pulse to a gate electrode of a transistor which easily deteriorates through a transistor to a gate electrode of which a high potential (VDD) is applied, is included.

The transducer vibrates its exciter feature in correspondence with audio signals transmitted to the transducer to broadcast corresponding sounds into the interior of the building by resonance induced in the door by the vibrating exciter feature. The sounds can resemble conventional alerting sounds such as a knocking or ringing sounds, and/or can be a spoken message either prerecorded in an audio source or created contemporaneously by being spoken by the user into a microphone. The device may be hand carried door to door as by delivery personnel and emergency workers and used to effectively alert occupants and eliminate the need for hand knocking or yelling a message through the door.

The code paths are implemented as part of compiled code for the applications and the code path directives enable delivery of different experiences to clients without changing the compiled code or re-deploying the application through an application store, or otherwise. In various implementations, analytics data that describes contextual characteristics for usage of a client application having alternative code paths is obtained by a service. The service selects one of the code paths based on processing of the collected analytics data and configures a corresponding code path directive to contain an indication of the selected code paths. Then, communication of the code path directive to the client device causes the client application to execute using the selected code path.

(actual title) High-contrast engine connecting rod
(abstract)
After a connecting rod for an engine is formed, it is broken or fractured at a fracture point to allow the connecting rod to assemble around a portion of a crankshaft. However, before fracturing the connecting rod, the connecting rod is provided with a layer of paint across the eventual fracture point such that when the connecting rod is fractured the paint extends across both sides of the fracture point. Also before fracturing the connecting rod, serial numbers or symbols are etched into the paint on either side of the eventual fracture point. These serial numbers are unique to that connecting rod, and have similar indicia on either side of the connecting rod. The combination of the paint and serial numbers increase the ability of an assembly worker to assure matching parts of an original connecting rod are re-attached during assembly about the crankshaft.

Embodiments combine analytical and statistical modelling utilizing in-memory computing, to process large amounts of unmodified source data, calculate cost measures rapidly without preaggregation, and/or run linear regression models on the same data set and in the same memory space without a need for separate hardware. An engine in communication with the in-memory database that comprises a large volume of available data, is configured to receive values for OLI factors as inputs. In response, the engine is configured to process these inputs according to the modeling template to provide corresponding cost measures as outputs.
