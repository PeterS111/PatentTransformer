(predicted abstract) Various embodiments of the invention provide for a method for removing virtual machine snapshots that are associated with a snapshot. The method may comprise identifying one or more virtual machines that are associated with a snapshot. The method may also comprise identifying for each of the identified one or more virtual machines a list of the virtual machine snapshots of the virtual machine. The method may further comprise, based on each of the identified one or more virtual machines and the list of virtual machine snapshots, selecting at least one of the identified one or more virtual machines for removal.
(actual abstract) Techniques are described herein which minimize the impact of virtual machine snapshots on the performance virtual machines and hypervisors. In the context of a volume snapshot which may involve (i) taking virtual machine snapshots of all virtual machines associated with the volume, (ii) taking the volume snapshot, and (iii) removing all the virtual machine snapshots, the virtual machine snapshots may be created in a first order and removed in a second order. Specifically, snapshots for busy virtual machines (i.e., virtual machines with higher disk write activity) may be created last and removed first. Consequently, snapshots of busy virtual machines are retained for shorter periods of time, thereby minimizing the effect of virtual machine snapshots on those virtual machines (and their associated hypervisors) that would be most negatively impacted by virtual machine snapshots.

The tool comprises a body having upper and lower members connected by a shear component. A rod is connected to the upper member, and the tool can be lowered with the rod into the wellbore or drill string to a desired depth. At the desired depth, locking means are deployed to lock the tool in position, the tool is sealed, and cement can be injected through the tool to the annulus of the outer casing. In some embodiments the tool is locked using a pushing motion that extends locking members outwardly from the tool to engage the wellbore walls or the inner surfaces of the drill string. Once cementing is completed, the rod is pulled from surface thereby causing the shear component to rupture and the upper and lower members to disconnect, and the upper member can be drawn to surface leaving the rest of the tool downhole. The tool does not require rotation to recover the rod, hence reducing the risk of loosening the threaded connections of lengths of drill pipe.

(actual abstract) Disclosed is a floor assembly for a modular building unit that avoids the need to turn the floor assembly frame over for installation of a floor subsheet, and that likewise provides a modular floor subsheet that may be fitted to the modular building unit without welding, rivets, screws, or other tooling. A floor assembly frame includes side rails that form the exterior, bottom perimeter of the modular building unit, and joists that extent between parallel side rails of the floor assembly frame. The joists are configured at their base on one side with a slot configured to receive one end of a section of a floor subsheet. An opposite end of the floor subsheet is then positioned overtop the joist element that forms the top portion of the slot on an adjacent joist, which opposite end may then be held in place with a pin, clip, or other fastener requiring minimal effort to install. Such assembly allows all components of the floor to be installed from above, thus avoiding the need to invert the frame of the floor assembly during installation. Likewise, the modular nature of the assembly allows installation to be carried out by fewer personnel than required in traditional installations.

(actual abstract) An enhanced thermal interface material (TIM) gap filler for filling a gap between two substrates (e.g., between a coldplate and an electronics module) includes microcapsules adapted to rupture in a magnetic field. The microcapsules, which are distributed in a TIM gap filler, each have a shell that encapsulates a solvent. One or more organosilane-coated magnetic nanoparticles is/are covalently bound into the shell of each microcapsule. In one embodiment, (3-aminopropyl) trimethylsilane-coated magnetite nanoparticles are incorporated into the shell of a urea-formaldehyde (UF) microcapsule during in situ polymerization. To enable easy removal of one substrate affixed to another substrate by the enhanced TIM gap filler, the substrates are positioned within a magnetic field sufficient to rupture the microcapsule shells through magnetic stimulation of the organosilane-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The ruptured microcapsule shells release the solvent, which dissolves and/or swells the TIM gap filler, thereby reducing the bond strength between the substrates.

(actual abstract) Methods, media, and systems are provided for characterizing the synchronization behavior of a slave clock. A sequence of sync packets, usable to synchronize with a grandmaster clock, is transmitted from the grandmaster clock to a slave clock. The sequence of sync packets is modified by dropping one or more sync packets from the sequence, providing a pattern of dropped sync packets. A synchronization output of the slave clock is monitored and, based on the synchronization output, a determination is made as to whether the slave clock is synchronized while the sequence of sync packets is modified. A characterization of the synchronization behavior of the slave clock is stored with respect to the pattern of dropped sync packets. The process may be repeated for various patterns of dropped sync packets.

(actual abstract) Reframing is used to re-size an image or video content, e.g. for displaying video signals with a given aspect ratio on a display having a different aspect ratio. Window cropping parameters (position and size over time) are constrained in order to optimise the rate/distortion of the encoded output video signal. Initial reframing is improved by computing a saliency map representing a user attention map which considers the video coding context and by providing a macroblock coding efficiency cost map and then taking the saliency map or a combined saliency/coding cost map into account so that the coding cost for said reframed video signal is smaller than the coding cost for other candidate reframing windows' sizes and positions.

(predicted abstract) In a brake control apparatus, a parking brake control amount calculator calculates the parking brake control amount of each vehicle wheel and a braking force of each vehicle wheel in such a manner as to allow a driver of a vehicle to parking the vehicle with only a load applied to the vehicle wheel while braking to prevent the vehicle and a forward vehicle while traveling on the same axis. Also, a traveling status determiner determines whether a vehicle traveling state is an acceptable traveling state or in a non-obtritive traveling state. The brake control amount calculator sets the parking brake control amount of a vehicle wheel to 1 when the traveling status determiner determines that the vehicle traveling status is not an acceptable traveling state, and the braking force is greater than the braking force of the vehicle wheel when the traveling status determiner determines that the vehicle traveling state is an acceptable traveling state.

(actual abstract) A new framework for video compressed sensing models the evolution of the image frames of a video sequence as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, from which the image frames are then reconstructed. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably yet obtain video recovery at a high frame rate that is in fact inversely proportional to the length of the video sequence. This property makes our framework well-suited for high-speed video capture and other applications. We validate our approach with a range of experiments including classification experiments that highlight the purposive nature of our framework.

(actual abstract) The present disclosure generally comprises a heated showerhead assembly that may be used to supply processing gases into a processing chamber. The processing chamber may be an etching chamber. When processing gas is evacuated from the processing chamber, the uniform processing of the substrate may be difficult. As the processing gas is pulled away from the substrate and towards the vacuum pump, the plasma, in the case of etching, may not be uniform across the substrate. Uneven plasma may lead to uneven etching. To prevent uneven etching, the showerhead assembly may be separated into two zones each having independently controllable gas introduction and temperature control. The first zone corresponds to the perimeter of the substrate while the second zone corresponds to the center of the substrate. By independently controlling the temperature and the gas flow through the showerhead zones, etching uniformity of the substrate may be increased.

(actual abstract) The present invention is a robotic system for maintaining product inventory and dispensing products upon request from a customer or other user. Product items are stored in an inventory storage unit (ISU), one item per bin. Controller logic allows items to be stored in, and retrieved from, arbitrarily-assigned storage locations. The bins hang on rails within drawers. In a replenishment operation, the system transfers empty bins to an operator station for replenishment. An operator fills the empty bins with product items. The system inserts these bins into drawers in the ISU. In a purge operation, the operator enters an identifier of a class of product to be removed. The system moves the bins containing the affected items to the operator station. After the product items are removed, the empty bins are moved to the ISU.

(actual abstract) Ray tracing, and more generally, graphics operations taking place in a 3-D scene, involve a plurality of constituent graphics operations. Responsibility for executing these operations can be distributed among different sets of computation units. The sets of computation units each can execute a set of instructions on a parallelized set of input data elements and produce results. These results can be that the data elements can be categorized into different subsets, where each subset requires different processing as a next step. The data elements of these different subsets can be coalesced so that they are contiguous in a results set. The results set can be used to schedule additional computation, and if there are empty locations of a scheduling vector (after accounting for the members of a given subset), then those empty locations can be filled with other data elements that require the same further processing as that subset.

The system executes one or more rules to determine whether an event represents a user account switch or the continued use of an account by a user currently logged onto the network. If so, the event is associated with an existing logon session. If not, the system determines whether the event satisfies criteria for a new user logon session.

(actual abstract) An object is to reduce power consumption of a display device and to suppress deterioration of display quality. As a transistor provided for each pixel, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer is used. Note that off-state current of the transistor can be decreased when the oxide semiconductor layer is highly purified. Therefore, variation in the value of a data signal due to the off-state current of the transistor can be suppressed. That is, display deterioration (change) which occurs when writing frequency of the data signal to the pixel including the transistor is reduced (when a break period is lengthened) can be suppressed. In addition, flickers in display which generates when the frequency of an alternating-current driving signal supplied to a signal line in the break period is reduced can be suppressed.

(actual abstract) When compiling high-level, graphical code (e.g. LabVIEW&#x2122; code) to a different representation (e.g. different software code or hardware FPGA), information relating to characteristics of the design may be collected/captured from the compilation process, and automatically provided to all the earlier stages of the compilation process to obtain more optimal results. Without automated feedback of this information, users have to manually identify, produce, and provide the feedback information, or forego the process altogether, having to assume that the tool has produced the best possible results when that may not be the case. To correct timing, failed constraints paths may be parsed and compared to delays obtained during a previous compile, and previous adjustments that didn't yield desired results may be undone. The longest delay that didn't result from an undone path may then be identified, and adjusted, and the process may be repeated until all paths are predicted to pass.

Generally, an electromagnetic coil is wrapped around a central magnet array. A shaft passes through the central magnet array, such that the central array may move along the shaft when the proper force is applied. When a current passes through the electromagnetic coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. The coil is stationary with respect to a housing of the actuator, while the central magnet array may move along the shaft within the housing. Thus, excitation of the coil exerts a force on the central magnet array, which moves in response to that force. The direction of the current through the coil determines the direction of the magnetic field and thus the motion of the central magnet array.

(predicted abstract) A method and apparatus for estimating temperature at or below a critical temperature from an integrated circuit in a semiconductor integrated circuit is disclosed. A temperature estimate for a core in the semiconductor integrated circuit is determined at an initial calibration temperature that is higher than a target temperature, and whether the temperature estimate is an accurate estimate of the temperature at or below the critical temperature is determined. When the temperature estimate is an accurate estimate, the temperature at the critical temperature is determined by measuring the time it takes for the temperature to reach a predetermined temperature. When the temperature estimate is not an accurate estimate, it is determined if the temperature estimate would increase or decrease due to a short circuit or other parasitic element in the core. Furthermore, a fault or similar action to an electrical path is initiated if the temperature estimate does not increase or decrease due to the short circuit.
(actual abstract) Methods and apparatuses are disclosed to estimate temperature at one or more critical points in a data processing system comprising modeling a steady state temperature portion of a thermal model at the one or more critical points using regression analysis; modeling the transient temperature portion of the thermal model at the one or more critical points using a filtering algorithm; and generating a thermal model at the one or more critical points by combining the steady state temperature portion of the thermal model with the transient temperature portion of the thermal model. The thermal model may then be used to estimate an instantaneous temperature at the one or more critical points or to predict a future temperature at the one or more critical points.
