(abstract)
A method and system is provided for maintaining customer data in a data store system utilizing a scalable partitioning framework. More specifically, the data store of a customer service system is partitioned (divided) into multiple partitions by a partitionable key of customer data so that each partition owns a subset of the customer data. By maintaining several partitions that store a subset of the customer data exclusive to each other, blackout or brownout problems can be local to one partition and, thus, the availability for the entire system will be increased. Moreover, a set of partitionable keys, a minimal unit to be moved between partitions, is grouped and associated with a partition. By eliminating direct dependencies between the partitions and the partitionable keys, the system can have great flexibility with regard to migrating customer data between partitions and adding a new partition.

(predicted claim) A post driver with limited movement floating post anvil apparatus comprising in combination a framework, a post; a first anvil fixed to said framework and having a bottom end adapted to carry a post anvil, said first anvil being movable relative to said framework to move up or down said post; a first fixed barrier on said framework below said first anvil, said first barrier being adapted for fixed engagement with the bottom end of said first anvil; a driver framework on said framework below said first barrier; a first fixed barrier on said framework above said driver framework; first means for fixedly coupling said first barrier to said driver framework above said first fixed barrier; a driver frame on said framework below said driver framework; said driver framework having an open top end; said first fixed barrier having its bottom end extending into said driver frame and through said open top end thereof to define a reservoir; second means for fixedly coupling said driver framework to said framework below said driver framework by engaging said first fixed barrier with said bottom end of said first fixed barrier, said second means being disposed outside said driver framework; a second fixed barrier fixed to said first moveable anvil; means for defining a chamber in said driver framework, said chamber being connected to said outlet of said first fixed barrier through said chamber, said chamber being defined by said open top end of said driver framework, said driver framework and said second fixed barrier.
(actual claim) A post driver comprising: <|span|> a weight; <|span|> a fixed upper barrier positioned below the weight, the fixed upper barrier having a through-hole extending therethrough, said hole being sized and shaped to allow at least a portion of the weight to pass at least partially therethrough; <|span|> a fixed lower barrier positioned below the fixed upper barrier, the fixed lower barrier being sized and shaped to allow a post to pass therethrough; <|span|> a floating anvil positioned entirely between the fixed upper barrier and the fixed lower barrier; and <|span|> a driver body, said driver body housing said weight, fixed upper barrier, fixed lower barrier, and <|span|> floating anvil therein, wherein said fixed upper barrier has a fixed position with respect to the driver body; <|span|> wherein said weight is positioned within said driver body to rise above the fixed upper barrier out of contact with the floating anvil and fall into contact with the floating anvil through the through-hole in the fixed upper barrier.
(abstract)
The post driver with limited movement floating post anvil does not rely heavily upon the skill of the operator to efficiently drive posts. The post anvil is allowed to move up and down in relation to the driver, but its movement is limited by both lower and upper fixed barriers. Since the movement is limited, the operator can position the driver upon the post allowing the full weight of the driver framework/carrier machine to rest upon the post. The post would push the floating post anvil upward only to the point at which the upper fixed barrier prevents further upward movement of the floating post anvil. Thus, once the floating post anvil abuts the upper fixed barrier, substantially the entire weight of the post driver is resting on the post.

(abstract)
Acoustic noise in an audio signal is reduced by calculating a speech probability presence (SPP) factor using minimum mean square error (MMSE). The SPP factor, which has a value typically ranging between zero and one, is modified or warped responsive to a value obtained from the evaluation of a sigmoid function, the shape of which is determined by a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is obtained by an evaluation of the signal energy and noise energy output from a microphone over time. The shape and aggressiveness of the sigmoid function is determined using an extrinsically-determined SNR, not determined by the MMSE determination.

While convention methods prepare carbon nanotube fibers by injecting a catalytic material for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes in a high-pressure supercritical state to be uniformly dispersed, the present invention uses a dispersant and thus does not require the injection in a high-pressure supercritical state.

(abstract)
Disclosed herein are systems, computer-implemented methods, and computer-readable storage media for recognizing speech by adapting automatic speech recognition pronunciation by acoustic model restructuring. The method identifies an acoustic model and a matching pronouncing dictionary trained on typical native speech in a target dialect. The method collects speech from a new speaker resulting in collected speech and transcribes the collected speech to generate a lattice of plausible phonemes. Then the method creates a custom speech model for representing each phoneme used in the pronouncing dictionary by a weighted sum of acoustic models for all the plausible phonemes, wherein the pronouncing dictionary does not change, but the model of the acoustic space for each phoneme in the dictionary becomes a weighted sum of the acoustic models of phonemes of the typical native speech. Finally the method includes recognizing via a processor additional speech from the target speaker using the custom speech model.

The fingerprint value may be used for matching the network metadata subclasses against relevant policies and transformation rules. For template-based network metadata such as NetFlow v9, an embodiment of the invention can constantly monitor network traffic for unknown templates, capture template definitions, and informs administrators about templates for which custom policies and conversion rules do not exist. Conversion modules can efficiently convert selected types and/or subclasses of network metadata into alternative metadata formats.

A data processing application uses a translation file to render a visual surface based on underlying structured data. The data processing application provides mapping between nodes associated with the visual surface and nodes associated with the structured data. The mapping is generated in two phases. In a first phase, the data processing application adds mapping functions to the translation file. In the second phase, the data processing application renders the visual surface on the basis of a specific instance of the structured data, and, in the process, executes the mapping functions within the translation file to provide specific pointer information that is embedded amongst the nodes associated with the visual surface. The pointer information points back to specific locations in the structured data, thus providing mapping between the visual surface and the structured data. The structured data can be formed using Extensible Markup Language (XML). The visual surface can be formed using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The translation file can be formed using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).

(abstract)
When a request of a warming-up of a transmission is generated, a hybrid ECU sets a target input rotational speed of the transmission where a heat loss quantity of a MG becomes maximum, based on a request driving force of a vehicle. In this case, the heat loss quantity is a quantity of a heat loss causing an increasing of a temperature of an ATF in the MG. Thus, the hybrid ECU sets the target input rotational speed where the heat loss quantity becomes maximum and controls the transmission and the MG to output power that meets the request driving force of the vehicle. Since the hybrid ECU controls a torque of the MG, a torque of the engine, and a transmission ratio of the transmission to achieve the target input rotational speed, the hybrid ECU controls the MG, the engine, and the transmission in a condition that the heat loss quantity becomes maximum.

(abstract)
User input gloves and input methods are described that are well suited to provide input to computer modeling (eg CAD) and augmented reality (AR) systems, including wearable AR and spatial AR. Each glove comprises palm mounted ultrasonic transducers, accelerometers, finger based pinch inputs and a wireless communication module. The gloves can be used to measure distances over the natural range of distances that hands can be placed, as well as their orientation, with sufficient resolution to facilitate a range of gesture based input methods to be developed and utilized, including distance-based modeling by measurement. Further the gloves are light weight, allow fast input of modeling measurements, are easy to use, and reduce fatigue compared to existing glove based input systems. The user input gloves, and associated input techniques can be used to measure small and body sized objects using one or two hands, and large objects can be measured using single handed measurements. Further models for both small and large objects can be generated and manipulated through the use of a numeric input technique to obtain an amplification factor to magnify the effective distances measured.

(abstract)
Plural image planes are illuminated through a single image-collecting objective system. The field of view or magnification (or both), is allocated dynamically among the plural planes. Preferably the planes include two detector planes&#x2014;one corresponding to a wide field of view (FOV) and the other to a steerable narrow one. Allocation is performed by a beam splitter in combination with a steering mirror, or steering-mirror array, that steers both fields together. The splitter isolates radiation corresponding to the narrow FOV from radiation corresponding to the wide FOV. In method forms of the invention, an electrooptical observation system produces simultaneous plural images for a region of interest. The system displays simultaneous images having respective plural resolutions. In operation a first, relatively wider FOV continuously covers a region of interest; while the second is narrower and has finer resolution than the first.

A picker associated with respective FIFO(s) begins an empty arbitration packet that includes a location for each output port and fills one or more locations in the packet, such as based on a prioritization scheme. Each packet is passed in a ring to another picker, which performs a fill that does not conflict with previously filled locations in that packet. Each picker has an opportunity to place requests in each of the packets. Results of the arbitration are dispatched to reorder buffers associated with respective output ports and used to schedule the interconnect. Each arbitration cycle thus produces a set of control information for an interconnect to be used in subsequent data transfer steps.
