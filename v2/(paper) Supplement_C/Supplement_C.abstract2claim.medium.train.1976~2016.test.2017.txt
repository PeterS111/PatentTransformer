(actual claim) A method for secure electronic mail delivery comprising: <|span|> receiving, at a message delivery server, a message for delivery to a receiving computer; <|span|> determining, by the message delivery server, whether the message is one of an encrypted real message and an encrypted phantom message; and <|span|> discarding, by the message delivery server, the message in response to determining that the message is an encrypted phantom message.
(abstract)
A network is disclosed that includes a message originator computer and a message recipient computer, for secure electronic mail delivery. In accordance with the invention, the network includes a message delivery server that can distinguish between real and phantom messages. In operation, the message originator computer waits a random time and then transmits a first encrypted phantom message to the message delivery server. This message is to spoof an eavesdropper into believing that there is a steady stream of messages being sent from the originator computer. However, the message delivery server recognizes the message as a phantom message and discards it. When the message originator computer receives a user request to transmit a real message to the recipient computer, it waits a random time and then encrypts and transmits the real message to the message delivery server. The message delivery server recognizes the message as a real message and forwards the real message to the recipient computer. Meanwhile, the message originator computer can continue transmitting encrypted phantom messages to the message delivery server. In this manner, an eavesdropper will be tricked into believing that there is a steady stream of messages being sent from the originator computer.

(abstract)
Techniques are described herein for automatically selecting the compression techniques to be used on tabular data. A compression analyzer gives users high-level control over the selection process without requiring the user to know details about the specific compression techniques that are available to the compression analyzer. Users are able to specify, for a given set of data, a &#x201c;balance point&#x201d; along the spectrum between &#x201c;maximum performance&#x201d; and &#x201c;maximum compression&#x201d;. The point thus selected is used by the compression analyzer in a variety of ways. For example, in one embodiment, the compression analyzer uses the user-specified balance point to determine which of the available compression techniques qualify as &#x201c;candidate techniques&#x201d; for the given set of data. The compression analyzer selects the compression technique to use on a set of data by actually testing the candidate compression techniques against samples from the set of data. After testing the candidate compression techniques against the samples, the resulting compression ratios are compared. The compression technique to use on the set of data is then selected based, in part, on the compression ratios achieved during the compression tests performed on the sample data.

(abstract)
An RF PA is designed to operate efficiently for average powers when biased at the system supply voltage, and uses an envelope tracking power supply to boost the bias voltage to maintain good efficiency at higher powers. As a result, for a majority of the time when transmitting average power signals, the RF PA bias voltage is the system-wide supply voltage (e.g. 3.4V in cell phones), which eliminates the need for stepping down voltages. The bias voltage is boosted during the less frequent times when higher power is needed. As a result, only a boost type of DC voltage converter is needed. The efficiency of the RF PA is therefore increased because voltage conversion is required less frequently and only when higher power RF signals are transmitted.

(abstract)
A method is disclosed for improving the quality of photographs taken in low-light conditions by adjustment of shutter speed and digital gain based on a shutter prioritization value. Using a network of sensor, a digital camera processes various parameters, such as luminance of the scene and movement of the camera or of subjects within the scene, to compute a shutter prioritization value. The value is then used to select the most appropriate shutter speed and digital gain combination from a constant exposure curve. Higher prioritization values correspond to faster shutter speeds and higher digital gain. Lower prioritization values correspond to lower shutter speeds and lower digital gain. In further embodiments, the shutter prioritization value may be manually customized by a user in order to produce artistic effects.

(abstract)
An electromagnetic transducer for sound and ultrasound reproduction includes a substantially flat coil coupled to a diaphragm that is near to and facing the North or South side of a magnet. A very thin membrane made from a non-magnetic but electrically conductive material is independently mounted from the diaphragm and faces it. An AC signal in the coil results in diaphragm movement and &#x201c;modulates&#x201d; the permanent magnetic field. The modulating field generates a current in the membrane, which, upon further interactions, causes the membrane to move. The two independently moving surfaces each generate sound and result in an unusually flat SPL/frequency response, with unusually low narrow-band intensity variation and very low distortion. The transducer is also unique among electromagnetic transducers in that the force acting on the membrane is uniformly distributed over much of it, as in an electrostatic sound transducer.

(actual claim) A shutter device comprising: <|span|> a first shutter driving mechanism including a first motor, a first driven member configured to be driven by the first motor, and <|span|> a first light shielding member configured to be driven by the first driven member so as to open or close an aperture; <|span|> a second shutter driving mechanism including a second motor, a second driven member configured to be driven by the second motor, and <|span|> a second light shielding member configured to be driven by the second driven member so as to open or close an aperture; and <|span|> a control unit configured to control the first motor and the second motor, <|span|> wherein in a case where the shutter device performs a first-frame shooting operation, the control unit controls the first motor and the second motor such that the first shutter driving mechanism performs an exposure operation prior to an exposure operation of the second shutter driving mechanism, <|span|> wherein in a case where the shutter device performs a second-frame shooting operation directly after the first-frame shooting operation, the control unit controls the first motor and the second motor such that the second shutter driving mechanism performs an exposure operation prior to an exposure operation of the first shutter driving mechanism, <|span|> wherein each of the first and second driven members is configured to provide a first driven zone and a second driven zone, <|span|> wherein in a case where the first and second driven members are driven in the first driven zone, the first and second light shielding members maintain the closed state or the open state and do not continue to travel in a same direction, even if the first driven member or the second driven member is moved, and <|span|> wherein in a case where the first and second driven members are driven in the second driven zone, the first and second light shielding members travel from the closed state to the open state or from the open state to the closed state.
(abstract)
When a stepping motor is used as a driving source for a shutter device, if the stepping motor loses synchronization because of variations in load during driving or the like, it becomes unable to rotate a driving ring at that time, and this disables an exposure operation. In a first zone where a driven member is driven, but a light shielding member remains in a closed state or an open state, the motor drives the driven member in open-loop driving mode. In a second zone where the driven member is driven, and thus the light shielding member moves to the closed state or the open state, the motor drives the driven member in feed-back driving mode.

(abstract)
The application relates to a hearing device comprising a beamformer of the generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC) type. The application further relates to a method of operating a hearing device. The disclosure addresses a problem which occurs when using a GSC structure in a hearing device application. The problem arises due to a non-ideal target-cancelling beamformer. As a consequence, a target signal impinging from the look direction can&#x2014;unintentionally&#x2014;be attenuated by as much as 30 dB. To resolve this problem, it is proposed to monitor the difference between the output signals from the all-pass beamformer and the target-cancelling beamformer to control a time-varying regularization parameter in the GSC update. This has the advantage of providing a computationally simple solution to the non-ideality of the GSC beamformer. The invention may e.g. be used in hearing aids, headsets, ear phones, active ear protection systems, or combinations thereof.

(abstract)
Existing algorithms to build balanced tree structures (&#x201c;b-trees&#x201d;) compare a data element (e.g., a key) to be inserted with the data elements that have already been inserted to find the correct position to insert the data element. Additionally, the algorithms balance and/or rebalance the b-tree when any individual node gets over-filled. As part of this balancing, data elements stored in the various nodes are moved to other nodes. These operations can incur both time and resource costs. We propose an algorithm to build a b-tree in a bottom up manner and a technique to modify trees built using the aforementioned algorithm so that they are balanced. We also propose a method to allow for adding more data into the thus-built b-tree as long as it follows a certain set of pre-conditions.
