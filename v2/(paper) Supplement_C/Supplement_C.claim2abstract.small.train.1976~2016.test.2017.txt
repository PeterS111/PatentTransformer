Further, since the movement speed of photons is higher than that of electrons and the signal interference of photons is lower than that of electrons, an additional effect of increasing the operating speed of the device or decreasing the size of the device can be expected.

(actual abstract) Boost-type switch-mode rectifiers (SMR) commonly use a resistor or a magnetic current sensor to measure the instantaneous input or inductor current that is used as the feedback to the current controller. A novel current sensorless scheme is described that computes the inductor current from the measured inductor voltage in a single-phase boost-type SMR using an adaptive low pass filter. This calculation requires an estimate of the inductance and the equivalent series resistance of the inductor coil. Both these parameters are dependent on operating conditions and are updated continuously. This is done using an adaptive model of the inductor that computes these parameters of the inductor once in every half cycle of the input current. The adaptation scheme is robust against parameter variations. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique which provides comparable performance to standard measured feedback current scheme both under steady-state and transient conditions.

Removing the top portion of the impurity absorbing layer by means of sputtering etch or RIE etch processes followed by optional oxidization process, a thin but thermally stable portion of impurity absorbing layer is formed on top of the magnetoresistive element with a low damping constant. Accordingly, a reduced write current can be achieved for spin-transfer torque MRAM application.

(predicted abstract) In a control apparatus for an internal combustion engine or the like, a control method determines whether or not a predetermined air-fuel ratio correction mode is selected, and executes the selected air-fuel ratio correction based on engine-speed-varying characteristic such that the output value of an upstream-side sensor becomes an output value corresponding to a target air-fuel ratio. This makes it possible to improve the accuracy of an air-fuel ratio correction by increasing a learning value when the predetermined air fuel ratio correction mode is selected.
(actual abstract) An electronic control unit executes air-fuel ratio control composed of main feedback correction and sub-feedback correction. The main feedback correction uses an output value of an upstream side sensor in upstream side of a catalyst. The sub-feedback correction uses an output value of a downstream side sensor in downstream side of the catalyst. When there are cylinder-to-cylinder variations in a fuel injection amount of each fuel injection valve, the electronic control unit corrects the fuel injection amount. Each time the degree of the cylinder-to-cylinder variations is lower than or equal to a first predetermined value, the electronic control unit stores the sub-learning value at that point in time as a normal value, and, when the degree of the cylinder-to-cylinder variations is higher than or equal to a second predetermined value, the electronic control unit changes the sub-learning value to the stored normal value.

(actual abstract) Potable drinking water is a scarce resource in many parts of developing countries, especially rural areas. Due to limited financial means of these countries, low cost point-of-use systems are thought to be appropriate technology to treat water. Systems using solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation could be successful since many vulnerable countries are located where solar radiation is intense and abundant throughout the year. The goal of this disclosure is to develop a simple and low cost point-of-use solar UV reactor to disinfect water. In this disclosure wavelength-dependent microbial dose-response behavior was investigated using surrogates to pathogenic microbes. A solar radiation prediction method based on the SMARTS model was used to predict solar UV intensity as function of geographic location and time. A numerical modeling procedure using the discrete ordinate (DO) model and CFD software (FLUENT) was used to simulate UV dose (distribution) delivery to microorganisms. Then, the dose distribution was combined with the dose response behavior using a segregated flow model to predict microbial inactivation by the reactor. A prototype was produced and tested to validate the numerical modeling procedure. The inactivation results from the prototype were in agreement with numerical inactivation prediction. The modeling procedure permits parameters such as reactor dimensions and material properties to be varied to meet a treatment goal.

If the jet is a compound jet, or a mixture of these two compounds, a jet is also provided in which the components of the component flow are formed in the form of a film which is deposited by impact or by pulsation on a surface immediately after a jet is formed.
(actual abstract) The object of the invention is the provision of methods for controlled production of continuous multi-component filaments or discreet structures using a multi-component liquid jet issuing from an orifice. A multi-component jet consists of two or more liquids. The liquids may be miscible or immiscible, and form a co-axially propagating flow along the central axis of a flow cell. The working distance between the exit orifice and a substrate can be as large as 50 mm, so that in-flight processing of the jet is possible. The coaxial flow consists of an outer sheath liquid and an inner sample liquid or composite of liquids. The flow cell and the exit channel of the deposition head are heated so that the pressurized sheath liquid temperature is raised to near or above the boiling point of the sheath liquid at the local atmospheric pressure. The jet exits the deposition head through the orifice, and the outer liquid is evaporated as the jet falls at atmospheric pressure. The sheath liquid is processed thermally, optically, or chemically during flight to form a protective or insulating layer for the inner liquid or liquids. The inner liquids may contrastingly consist of an ultraviolet (UV) curable ink that is processed in-flight or after deposition. Since UV curable inks contain no volatile components, the coaxial jetted filament can be processed without producing cracks or bubbles in the sheath layer. Line widths are produced in the range from approximately 1 to 1000 microns.

(predicted abstract) The present invention provides an intraocular probe for insertion into the eye to provide intraocular application of a therapeutic light, at a depth suitable for therapeutic purposes. The probe includes a therapeutic light source for providing therapeutic light, a shield, and an optical path into which the therapeutic light is directed and which is configured to direct the therapeutic light to target material. The shield is adapted to block radiation emitted by the therapeutic light source and/or reflected from the target material.
(actual abstract) An intraocular light probe has a mask or shield affixed at its distal end thereof which forms a directed light beam for intraocular application of light to target tissues or intraocular application of therapeutic light. The mask or shield serves to more fully focus, intensify and direct the beam toward the target tissues. The mask or shield also helps direct light away from other tissues and away from the eyes of the surgeon. By placing a light probe beneath a surgical instrument such as a phacoemulsifier or vitrector, laser, cutting instrument (e.g., scissors or knife), forceps or probe/manipulator, whether as part of or separate from an infusion sleeve, a mask or shield effect is created. This has the same benefits of directing the beam toward target tissues, away from other tissues and away from the eyes of the surgeon. The mask/shield can be removed from the fiberoptic light for sterilization. The device of the invention is preferably introduced into the eye via the primary or side-port incision to provide intraocular cross-lighting of tissues during surgical procedures such as cataract surgery, corneal surgery, vitrectomy, intraocular lens implantation, refractive surgery, glaucoma surgery and vitreo/retinal surgery.
