(predicted abstract) The present invention provides a capacitive touch screen and display device capable of reducing the resistance of wiring lines between an electrode and a capacitive touch unit by using a plurality of wires, and a method for fabricating the capacitive touch screen and display device. The capacitive touch screen includes a substrate, electrodes arranged in a two-dimensional pattern on the substrate, and protective resin that covers the electrodes and the substrate and is in contact with an upper surface of each of the electrodes and the substrate. The electrodes include a pair of wiring lines that are disposed in parallel on the substrate, and a plurality of wires that are electrically connected to the respective wiring lines and extend in a direction perpendicular to the substrate. The wiring lines have the same line length as each other, and the protective resin covers the wiring lines and the substrate.
(actual abstract) In a capacitive in-cell touch screen and a display device, the common electrode layer connected in the entire surface in the array substrate is divided to form touch driving electrodes and common electrodes which are insulated from each other and alternatively disposed, touch sensing electrodes are disposed on the upper substrate and touch driving electrodes are driven in a time-division manner to realize touch function and display function. Disposing projections of touch sensing electrodes on the array substrate in areas where common electrodes are may reduce right opposite areas between touch sensing electrodes and touch driving electrodes, thereby reduce opposite capacitance; providing sides of touch driving electrodes and adjacent sides of common electrodes as broken lines and providing consistent shapes for touch sensing electrodes and common electrodes may increase opposite areas between touch driving electrodes and touch sensing electrodes, thereby increasing projection capacitance per unit area. By increasing the proportion of projection capacitance over opposite capacitance, it is possible to increase proportion of variation amount of mutual capacitance caused by finger touching, and hence improving the touch accuracy.

(predicted abstract) To provide an image forming apparatus in which the contact force between a belt and a supporting member is larger than in the conventional image forming apparatus. A belt device 1 has an image carrying body 2 on which an electrostatic image is formed, and the supporting member 4 which is disposed in contact with the belt 2 with its lower portion 2a and rotatably supports the belt 2. The supporting member 4 is provided with an elastic portion 4a which is elastically deformed such that when the supporting member and belt are positioned in proximity to each other and the supporting member, the elastic force acting on the supporting member is decreased. Since the contact surface of the supporting member and the belt is larger, which is the contact force between the supporting member and the belt, the contact force between the supporting member and the belt is not increased. This reduces the contact energy which acts between the supporting member and the belt, which are the forces acting on the belt. As a result, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of the deflection of the belt, and to maintain the belt in a flat state.
(actual abstract) In an image forming apparatus, both a drum cartridge and a developer cartridge are detachably supported by a supporting member. The drum cartridge has an abutment portion. The developer cartridge includes a developer gripping portion. The developer gripping portion has a moving portion. The moving portion moves between a protruding position and an accommodated position. When the drum cartridge is mounted to the supporting member the abutment portion abuts against the moving portion to cause the moving portion to move to the accommodated position. When the drum cartridge is removed from the supporting member, abutment of the abutment portion against the moving portion is released to cause the moving portion to move to the protruding position.

(predicted abstract) Apparatus and a method are described for lining a pipe with a mixture of particles and liquid. The pipe to be lined is provided with a plurality of openings through which the mixture is injected through the pipe to be lined, whereupon the mixture is injected through the pipe and outward through the openings. The mixture is injected with at least one jet of gas which is directed through the mixture so as to create an essentially continuous, substantially horizontal, tangential stream of mixed particles and a downwardly directed flow of liquid. This upward directed flow of liquid provides the mixing action along the inside of the pipe to be lined.
(actual abstract) A cured in place liner system and associated connections and methods are disclosed. The cured in place pipe system forms a completely rehabilitated, stand-alone, fluid-tight flow path between upstream and downstream portions of an existing pipe system. The rehabilitated flow path is stand-alone in that the liner system does not rely on structure of the portion of the pipe system through which the liner system is installed to define the fluid-tight flow path. The flow path between upstream and downstream portions of the liner system is defined by and made fluid-tight solely by components of the rehabilitation system such as cured in place liners and couplers. The portion of the pipe system through which the rehabilitation system is installed merely provides a path (e.g., through the ground) through which the cured in place liner system can be inserted. After the cured in place liner system is installed, the liner system forms a fluid-tight flow path between an upstream portion of the pipe system and a downstream portion of the pipe system. Various types of connections may be used. In addition, various types of methods may be used in forming the connections, such as using a mold to cure connecting sections of the cured in place liners in desired configurations (e.g., having a generally circular outer profile) for forming connections with the liners.

(predicted abstract) A carrier modulation technique is defined which applies to multiple resonation modes, or resonators. The modulated signal is combined in one or more carrier modulation modes, such as the carrier modulation of the resonating frequency of the resonator. The resulting output signal is a multiplexed output signal. In one embodiment, a carrier signal is modulated to an intermediate frequency (IF), before being multiplexed. At that frequency, the output signal can be combined with one or more other components to generate a desired signal or an output signal which can be modified by an additional component. Additional components can be added, such as a modulator which has a frequency-dependent characteristic or which modulate a modulated carrier signal without a carrier frequency. Other components can include other resonators, switches, amplifiers, and filters. The resonators and filter components can be contained within an integrated circuit.
(actual abstract) An optical modulation apparatus for modulating an electromagnetic (e.g., radio frequency (RF)) signal onto an optical carrier signal may be arranged to feed back at least a portion of the optical carrier signal, while excluding first-order sidebands, which may help increase modulation efficiency and improve output power, while retaining high modulation bandwidth. Such arrangements may be implemented, for example, using a Fabry-Perot resonator or a ring resonator in combination with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer or a Michelson interferometer.

A guide wire lumen is defined longitudinally within the proximal end of the flex-circuit drift tube. An innermost coil is positioned within the guide wire lumen. The innermost coil is covered by an insulative coating over the interior surface of the guide wire lumen. A connector tube having a proximal end and a distal end is in slidable and rotatable engagement with the proximal end of the drift tube. The distal end of the connector is in contact with the innermost coil such that a proximal end of the connector tube is disposed longitudinally beyond the distal end of the drift tube. The proximal end of the connector tube is in contact with a rotatable drive wire. Rotation of the drive wire in accordance with a rotary motion of the distal end of the connector tube causes selective longitudinal displacement of the innermost coil along the guide wire lumen.
(actual abstract) The present disclosure is directed to an ion mobility drift tube fabricated using flex-circuit technology in which every other drift electrode is on a different layer of the flex-circuit and each drift electrode partially overlaps the adjacent electrodes on the other layer. This results in a self-shielding effect where the drift electrodes themselves shield the interior of the drift tube from unwanted electro-magnetic noise. In addition, this drift tube can be manufactured with an integral flex-heater for temperature control. This design will significantly improve the noise immunity, size, weight, and power requirements of hand-held ion mobility systems such as those used for explosive detection.

When the power supply is connected to the power supply and an enable signal is applied to the plate line, the word line is activated. The memory cell is read out, after an elapsed time, by applying a read enable signal that is the complement of the enable signal to the word line. Other functions of the memory cell can be selectively performed by activating two sub-array groups.
(actual abstract) A method and apparatus for reconfiguring hardware structures to pipeline the execution of multiple special purpose hardware implemented functions, without saving intermediate results to memory, is provided. Pipelining functions in a program is typically performed by a first function saving its results (the &#x201c;intermediate results&#x201d;) to memory, and a second function subsequently accessing the memory to use the intermediate results as input. Saving and accessing intermediate results stored in memory incurs a heavy performance penalty, requires more power, consumes more memory bandwidth, and increases the memory footprint. Due to the ability to redirect the input and output of the hardware structures, intermediate results are passed directly from one special purpose hardware implemented function to another without storing the intermediate results in memory. Consequently, a program that utilizes the method or apparatus, reduces power consumption, consumes less memory bandwidth, and reduces the program's memory footprint.

(actual abstract) In a genome sequencing system and methodology, a protocol is provided to achieve precise alignment and accurate registration of an image of a planar array of nanoballs subject to optical analysis. Precise alignment correcting for fractional offsets is achieved by correcting for errors in subperiod x-y offset, scale and rotation by use of minimization techniques and Moir&#xe9; averaging. In Moir&#xe9; averaging, magnification is intentionally set so that the pixel period of the imaging element is a noninteger multiple of the site period. Accurate registration is achieved by providing for pre-defined pseudo-random sets of sites, herein deletion or reserved sites, where nanoballs are prevented from attachment to the substrate so that the sites of the array can be used in a pattern matching scheme as registration markers for absolute location identification. Information can be extracted with a high degree of confidence that it is correlated to a known location, while at the same time the amount of information that can be packed on a chip is maximized.

Such a pressure sampling head includes a body portion formed in a one-piece configuration provided with an inlet end disposed in a lower part of the body portion and an outlet connected to a measuring apparatus, a cylinder portion connected to the inlet end of the body portion and provided with a flow passage formed at the bottom thereof, a piston movably fitted in the space of the cylinder portion and formed with a suction hole at the center thereof to be connected to the measuring apparatus, a tubular piston rod connected to an upper end of the piston so that the piston is moved up and down and movable in the axial direction, and a pressure sensitive element fixed to a lower end of the piston rod. The flow passage of the cylinder portion is provided with a plurality of first gas flow passage holes defined in the cylinder portion to be spaced from each other, a second gas flow passage hole defined at a predetermined central portion in the vicinity of an outlet port of the first gas flow passage hole and formed in a peripheral wall of the cylinder portion, and a first liquid flow path extending along the peripheral wall of the cylinder portion through the second gas flow passage hole, the first liquid flow path having gas flow passages defined therethrough and extending to the inlet end of the body portion, the gas flow passages of the first liquid flow path being connected to a gas pressure pump connected to the measuring apparatus.
(actual abstract) Present invention provides a high-precision pressure sampling head used in a Pitot tube flow sensor. The pressure sampling head includes a cylindrical pressure sampling head body. The cylindrical pressure sampling head body contains a total pressure channel and a static pressure channel. The axis of the total pressure channel and the axis of the static pressure channel are parallel to the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Two inclined surfaces are formed on two opposite sides of the lower end of the cylindrical pressure sampling body. A first inclined surface intersects with the total pressure channel and thus a total pressure sensing hole is formed on the first inclined surface. A second inclined surface intersects with the static pressure channel and thus a static pressure sensing hole is formed on the second inclined surface. An angle &#x3b1; formed between the first inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body is smaller than the angle &#x3b2; formed between the second inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Based on experimental results, when measuring the volume flow rate of a liquid in a pipe or conduit using the pressure sampling head according to the present invention, the fluid can flow stably through the pressure sampling head, with a high differential pressure between the total pressure sensing hole and the static pressure sensing hole. Thus, a pressure differential measuring device can more easily collect the data and achieve a higher precision of measurement. The measurement precision class can reach between 0.2-0.5.

The first set of data is used to determine a first branch prediction of branch conditions of a branch instruction, wherein the first branch prediction is configured for predicting a non-branch execution of each of the plurality of operands. The second branch prediction of branch conditions is added to a plurality of branch conditions of the branch instruction to generate a third branch prediction of a non-branch execution of the branch instruction. Thereafter, an updated set of data is generated for the branch instruction by adding the third branch prediction to the first set of data.
(actual abstract) A microprocessor processes conditional non-branch instructions that specify a condition and instruct the microprocessor to perform an operation if the condition is satisfied and otherwise to not perform the operation. A predictor provides a prediction about a conditional non-branch instruction. An instruction translator translates the conditional non-branch instruction into a no-operation microinstruction when the prediction predicts the condition will not be satisfied, and into a set of one or more microinstructions to unconditionally perform the operation when the prediction predicts the condition will be satisfied. An execution pipeline executes the no-operation microinstruction or the set of microinstructions. The predictor translates into a second set of one or more microinstructions to conditionally perform the operation when the prediction does not make a prediction. In the case of a misprediction, the translator re-translates the conditional non-branch instruction into the second set of microinstructions.

(predicted abstract) A method for handling interruptible blocking with serialization of a messaging interruptible message is disclosed. A first interruptible block is received from a server of a server computer system of an operator, the first interruptible block corresponding to the message. It is determined if the first interruptible block is enabled for an interruptible block wait for processing. If the first interruptible block is not enabled for an interruptible block wait and a message is received from the server at a first time, the message for a second time prior to the first time is processed. However, a second interruptible block is received from the server, the second interruptible block corresponding to the message. It is determined if the second interruptible block is enabled for an interruptible block wait for processing by comparing an interruptible block wait time of processing the message to the second time. If the second interruptible block is not enabled for an interruptible block wait for processing by comparing the interruptible block wait time to an interruptible block wait time of processing the message, an interruptible block wait sequence is processed.
(actual abstract) Enhanced message passing architectures and libraries include an interruptible wait feature. After a thread X calls a completion-awaiting routine of a message passing interface library, a progress engine executes while the routine is in the blocked condition. A thread Y interrupts the routine before all messaging operations are completed. The interrupted routine returns control to thread X with an indication that the routine's completion condition is unsatisfied. The completion-awaiting routine may have the same function signature as a standard MPI routine. In some cases, thread Y interrupts the routine while requesting a lock held by thread X. In some applications, thread X is a communication thread and thread Y is one of multiple worker threads. The interruptible wait feature may be joined by an asynchronous callback feature, which associates a callback with a deterministic execution context.

(predicted abstract) A back lighting system of this invention includes a specular partial reflector and a circular-mode reflective polarizer. Because the circular-mode reflective polarizer is placed in the direction of the light from the light source with respect to the specular partial reflector, the light incident from the light source enters the specular partial reflector after being reflected by the specular partial reflector and then exits the device through the circular-mode reflective polarizer. Accordingly, even through the circular-mode reflective polarizer, the light has a better polarization uniformity than the light from the light source. Accordingly, the light can be effectively reflected by the circular-mode reflective polarizer to enable a backlight device to work.

The conformal spacer thus wraps around the mandrels and is also deposited on an underlying layer. A fill material is deposited to fill gaps or spaces between sidewall spacers. A CMP planarization step then removes substrate stack material down to a material interface of the bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel, with a middle or lower material of the mandrel being a CMP-stop material. This technique essentially cuts off or removes rounded features such as upper portions of sidewall spacers, thereby providing a spacer material with a planar top surface that can be uniformly etched and transferred to underlying layers.

(actual abstract) The method for the preparation of epoxy-clay nanocomposites uses high shear mixing of Nanomer I.30 E nanoclay into the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy by optimization of high shear mixing speeds, mixing times and degassing temperature. The results showed that the optimum high shear mixing speed and mixing time for optimal clay dispersion were 6000 rpm and 60 min, respectively. Increasing the degassing temperature from 65&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. for the first two hours of the degassing process enhanced nanoclay dispersion, resulting in nanocomposites with a morphology dominated by disorder intercalation with some exfoliated structure. This enhancement in nanocomposite morphology can be attributed to the improvement in epoxy diffusion into the intergallery spacing between clay layers due to temperature rise.

(actual abstract) Nozzle arms for holding discharge heads are caused by a pivotal driving part to move between a processing position above a substrate and a standby position outside a processing cup surrounding a substrate. When the nozzle arms having cleaned a substrate is placed at the standby position, a cleaning solution is ejected from a shower nozzle toward the nozzle arms arranged obliquely downward of the shower nozzle. The three nozzle arms are caused to move up and down such that the nozzle arms cut across a jet of a cleaning solution discharged obliquely downward, thereby cleaning the three nozzle arms in order. Then, a nitrogen gas is ejected from a drying gas nozzle and sprayed on the nozzle arms to remove the cleaning solution attached to the nozzle arms, thereby drying the nozzle arms.

(predicted abstract) An integrated circuit having a high magnetoresistive (MR) memory element and a magnetoresistive (MR) read element both formed according to a process that begins by forming a first electrically conductive layer, covering the first electrically conductive layer with an inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer, patterning the amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer and the electrically conductive layer to form a first stack, and forming a second electrically conductive layer, covering the second electrically conductive layer with a spin valve (SV) reference layer. The SV reference layer exhibits magnetization that rotates toward the first electrically conductive layer in response to electrical current passing therethrough. The inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer serves as a barrier to inhibit oxygen diffusion and/or diffusion between the first and second electrically conductive layers and serve as a seed layer for the inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer. When an electrical current is passed in a direction substantially transverse to the plane of the inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer through the SV reference layer and through the electrically conductive layer, the inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer has its magnetization substantially fixed and the inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer is made of an amorphous magnetic material which exhibits a reduced critical current and an increased resistance to electron flow when magnetically annealed or thermally annealed. The inversely doped amorphous ferromagnetic (AP) layer and the spin valve (SV) reference layer, in combination function to reduce the magnetoresistance of the MR memory element. The reduced magnetoresistance makes the magnetoresistive (MR) memory element very resistant to magnetic fields created by read current signals. The MR read element provides a relatively high resistance to electron flow when said read element is placed into magnetic coupling with a magnetic medium and to current through the MR read element when said MR read element is read.

In subsea applications, the top of the pipe may then be raised clear of the blowout preventer within a marine riser. A blind ram and annular preventer can then be closed above the remnant of the pipe being retained by the pipe catcher. The pipe above the cut is removed through the marine riser and the marine riser itself is then disconnected. The rig is then driven off the well. If the well is reactivated the steps are reversed but the well is safely secured before the blowout preventer components are opened. The pipe supported by the catcher is independently supported before the catcher is released and the pipe lifted through the riser.

(predicted abstract) A method is set forth for handling or storing, or transporting a large number of workpieces at different pressures using a vacuum or high pressure fluid stream. The vacuum or high pressure fluid stream is applied to an array of vacuum ports or pressure ports to retain the workpieces in contact with a central ring having an inner diameter sufficient to receive the vacuum. The pressure ports are connected to a vacuum source and a separate gas source to provide a pressure difference between the pressure of the gas provided to the pressure ports and the pressure of the gas provided to the central ring. The pressure difference is sufficient to maintain a substantially uniform and substantially uniform vacuum across the workpieces. The central ring is rotated and the central ring is moved from the first position toward a second position. The workpieces are moved to a first position by rotation of the central ring between the first and second positions. The pressure difference in the central ring causes the workpieces to compress when moving from the first position to the second position. The compressed workpieces are moved from the second position to a third position by rotation of the central ring between the second and third positions. The workpieces are moved to a fourth position by the compressed workpieces in the vacuum stream. In this manner, high pressure fluid is applied to the workpieces in an array such that the workpieces compress into a substantially uniform shape without being distorted during transport.

The color measurement system and method of the present invention automatically produce a color measurement having very low sensitivity to ambient light and, thus, not have to be compensated for. In the present invention the light values from the object are measured in three different measurement channels. From the measurements in the first and third measurement channels, the values of color measurement are produced, and the color measurement of the object is produced by comparing the color measurement in the second measurement channel with the color measurement in the third measurement channel, which is the measurement in the middle of the measurement in the second channel. The color measurement in the middle of the first measurement channel can be used as a reference color for the third color measurement for subsequent color measurements, e.g. the actual object measurement.

(predicted abstract) A method of compensating for a flow of fluid from a pressurized fluid source to a consumer and for cooling the output fluid temperature at an output of a fluid pressure control circuit. The method comprises the steps of: detecting a fluid temperature of the fluid at the output of the pressure control circuit, determining a reference fluid temperature based on the detected fluid temperature, and determining a volume compensation for the output fluid temperature as a function of temperature increase of the control circuit output pressure. The method further includes the steps of determining a volume compensation for the output fluid temperature as a function of temperature increase of at least one of the consumer and the output pressure of the control circuit and the volume compensation is selected to compensate for the change in volume caused by the temperature of the control circuit output when the temperature at the output approaches the output fluid temperature using the volume compensation. The method further includes a step of adjusting the volume compensation for the output fluid temperature by using the volume compensation for the output fluid temperature. In one embodiment thereof, the step of adjusting the volume compensation for the output fluid temperature is performed as a function of operating point pressure, the fluid temperature in the output of the control circuit, and the output fluid temperature at an output of the control circuit. In another embodiment thereof, the volume compensation is adjusted using the pressure differential between the input fluid pressure and the output fluid pressure based on operating point pressure.
(actual abstract) A pressure compensation system for enclosed spaces at a subterranean location changes volume with thermally induced solubility changes of a salt in water. The salt is held in an enclosure that is either rigid, or impervious and flexible or porous and flexible. As well conditions change and temperature increases, some of the salt goes into solution with a resulting decrease in volume that compensates for thermally induced volume increase due to temperature increase in the borehole. Conversely, a decrease in borehole temperature brings some of the salt out of solution for a volume increase to offset the volume decrease of the adjacent fluid to keep the pressure stabilized in the enclosed volume. In the porous enclosure embodiment the openings are sufficiently small to retain the salt even in solution. However, minimal net flows are anticipated for pressure compensation due to changing thermal effects.

The deposited material is then heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the liquid metal or gel to flow, thereby causing the deposited material to bond to the patterned substrate. This bonding allows the patterned structure to be released from the patterned substrate, so as to form the desired pattern. In addition, the patterned substrate can be bent while it is in the liquid state, to form a micro-wiring structure with a desired shape.

(predicted abstract) High-speed bi-directional video compression and decompression are used during real-time transport of video and audio data in a data packetized network such as the Internet, a cable network, or a wireless network without use of a conventional real-time encoder/decoder or other type of real-time decoder or decompressor. According to this invention, a series of one or more compressed frames is stored in the same buffer memory as its original data. In addition, the present invention uses the time series of the stored frames to reconstruct the original data. Additionally, one or more decompressed frames is written to another buffer memory, thereby providing time-synchronized data access on the original data. In each of the embodiments, at least one of the compressed frames and the decompressed frames includes one or more pictures containing at least one reference frame at the time the frame is received.
(actual abstract) A method, a system and a computer device for initiating bi-directional compression of a video stream in a packet switched network, based on delay tolerance of a service or application. A video frame recompression (VFR) utility determines an end-to-end (E2E) delay tolerance retrieved from a Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) report. The VFR utility then determines the actual expected delay based on a deep inspection of packet headers. The VFR utility utilizes a processing opportunity delay (which determines whether the E2E delay tolerance is greater than the actual expected delay) to reprocess video content comprising Intra-coded (I) pictures/frames and Predicted (P) frames to improve compression efficiency. The VFR utility may also utilize a complexity ratio which is a ratio of the I-Frame rate and the P-Frame rate to select frames for compression. The VFR utility recompresses video content by replacing P-Frames with B-Frames.

(predicted abstract) " In a car (10) there is positioned a hopper (11) which has a door (12) which may be opened from side to side by the application of pressure to a double acting pneumatic cylinder (24). The cylinder is actuated by a pressure sensor which is located between a lower flange (23) of the hopper (11) and a ridge (21) on the car roof. The lower flange (23) of the hopper is supported for movement to expose an elongate tube (17) to the hopper. The tube projects beyond the car roof so that the rod (13) of the hopper may be used for lifting and carrying the car. This tube is connected with a conduit (16) to a source of compressed air. The tube is connected to a source of air so that when the tube is raised, air flows through said conduit thus causing the cylinder to move upwardly to open the door and receive it into the car through an upper flange (38). A second pressure sensor (42) is preferably spaced from the first sensor (60). The second pressure sensor (42) provides a signal to a relay (34) which in turn provides an electrical signal to a pneumatic solenoid valve (35) which is connected to a battery (36) which can be connected to a source of electrical power. As the door opens, a pneumatic signal is sent to the solenoid valve (35) which actuates a solenoid valve (34) thus releasing air into an air chamber (30) inside the pneumatic cylinder (24) which causes the first pressure to be released, the air chamber (30) then closing a circuit so that the pressure in the air chamber (30) will not actuate the solenoid valve (34) thus preventing the hopper to be opened by an air line. The circuit is connected with the valve (35) for a period of use during which the second sensor (42) may be actuated and the valve (35) closed providing the pneumatic signal to the solenoid valve (34). If the door is closed without an object, the air pressure will not actuate the solenoid valve (35) thus preventing the hopper from being opened, even if the door is opened without a car object. The solenoid valve is also connected with a second air chamber (39) in which the air pressure would not actuate th

(predicted abstract) A method for detecting and processing current imbalance and/or failure of each harnessing wire to a corresponding load and/or circuit is disclosed. The method consists of measuring the current in each lead wire of each harness. The current is determined as a sum of components of the corresponding lead wire current. The average is then subtracted from the component current of each lead wire to form a component current vector and multiplied by a factor which is proportional to the total current in the conductive material of the harness. The resulting vector is then converted to a current vector which corresponds to the total current in the conductive material of each harness. The magnitude and direction of the current vector are compared to a corresponding plurality of reference vectors from a corresponding plurality of loads or circuit boards or capacitances. If one of the component current vectors with the corresponding reference vector is greater than its corresponding total component current vector, then an imbalance is detected. If the component current vector and the total component current vectors are not equal, then a failure is detected.

In some embodiments, each wire of a wire pair leading to the motor from the inverter may be provided with a line current sensor. A comparison of current output from each wire in the wire pair may be performed to determine if a current imbalance is present. In some embodiments, a phase current sensor may be coupled to a phase input of the inverter. Failures in the 3-phase system may be detected by measuring the output from each phase current sensor for imbalanced distribution of power output. In some embodiments, the output from the phase current sensors may be compared to an output of a line current sensor along the same phase for current imbalances or harness failures.

(actual abstract) The present technology concerns cell phones and other portable devices, and more particularly concerns use of such devices in connection with media content (electronic and physical) and with other systems (e.g., televisions, digital video recorders, and electronic program directories). Some aspects of the technology allow users to easily transfer displayed content from cell phone screens onto a television screens for easier viewing, or vice versa for content portability. Others enable users to participate interactively in entertainment content, such as by submitting plot directions, audio input, character names, etc., yielding more engaging, immersive, user experiences. Still other aspects of the technology involve a program directory database, compiled automatically from information reported by network nodes that watch and identify content traffic passing into (and/or out of) networked computers. By identifying content resident at a number of different repositories (e.g., web sites, TV networks, P2P systems, etc.), such a directory allows cell phone users to identify the diversity of sources from which desired content can be obtained&#x2014;some available on a scheduled basis, others available on demand. Depending on the application, the directory information may be transparent to the user&#x2014;serving to identify sources for desired content, from which application software can pick for content downloading, based, e.g., on context and stored profile data. A great number of other features and arrangements are also detailed.

Two-way wave equation-based data selection utilizes the 3D wave equation of wave equation-based wave-tracing as a basis for selective optimization of the wave field. The 3D wave equation includes a series of three-dimensional (3D) wave equation elements. Each wave equation element has wavefield data at the location determined by its three-dimensional (3D) position in the 3D space. The 3D wave equation elements are sequentially ordered, and the first wave equation element of the series is a base unit, and the remaining wave equation elements are individualized units. A wave-tracing algorithm is used to calculate multiple wave field parameters as a function of the wavefield data. The results of the wave-tracing algorithm are then sequentially ordered to compute multiple result parameters. The individual wave field parameters and the result parameters are selectively modified on-the-fly to improve the output image. The result from the wave-tracing algorithm and the results from the individual wave-tracing algorithms are then sequentially ordered to calculate final result parameters.
(actual abstract) The invention relates to seismic imaging where complex geologies are likely to create data that is confusing or ambiguous for a conventional matrix of acquisition source points and receiver locations. With some understanding of the geological substructure, the acquisition source points and receiver locations that optimize the imaging may be found by using a reciprocal two-way wave equation propagation method coupled with a quality geologic model. With this, the acquisition source points and receiver locations that optimize the imaging may be selected and used to better resolve the substructure and avoid the inclusion of data that obscures understanding of the substructure.

(predicted abstract) An image-sensing microscope for a moving biological, e.g., organ or tissue, molecule such as a heart, is utilized for displaying the relative movement of a region of interest in a time series. The method and apparatus utilize the fact that the motion of the molecule is represented by a time series of discrete values (in the form of a curve which is characteristic of a time series including the period of motion) which are then used to determine the position of at least one of said regions of interest in the time series at a time. The motion of the molecule is measured from at least two of said points. By dividing the time series into separate periods and then measuring the motion of the molecule, the relative movement of the molecule in three dimensions in space is measured, i.e., the time of passage of the molecule.

(predicted abstract) Provided is a process for increasing the texture of a thermally processedosized|PTFE fruit or vegetable having an oil portion and a fruit or vegetable portion. The process comprises adding a sufficient amount of a first amount of a first hydrocarbon material to the oil portion to form a first oil-rich portion of a thermally processed PTFE fruit or a thermally processed vegetable, and adding a sufficient amount of a second amount of a second hydrocarbon material to the fruit or vegetable portion to form a second oil-rich portion of the thermally processed PTFE fruit or a thermally processed vegetable, and blending, wherein in combination the second hydrocarbon material is an aliphatic compound that has 1-20 carbon atoms.
(actual abstract) Thermally processed fruits and vegetables are softer in texture than fresh. It is challenging to obtain acceptable texture from thermally processed IQF fruits and vegetables. The soaking method of the invention enhances the texture of high quality IQF fruits and vegetables before thermal processing resulting in a processed, shelf-stable fruit or vegetable product with significantly improved texture. When compared to other traditional firming methods using calcium salts added directly to the pack medium or finished product, or using a food enzyme, such as pectinmethylesterase (PME), the soaking method yields fruit and vegetable products with significantly better post-cook textures. Using this method will also enable manufacturers of shelf-stable fruit and vegetable products to use IQF ingredients in continuous year-round production.

(actual abstract) A method and associated systems for object identification and subsequent processing based on digital imaging and physical attributes. An object-identification system receives, in a materials-handling environment, a digital image and physical attributes that characterize an unidentified object. An attempt is made to identify the object by matching the image and attributes to those of known objects stored in an image database, an attribute database, or another external source. The object is associated with a label that identifies the actual object, associates the object with a similar object that may be substituted for the actual object in a desired application, or designates the object as unidentifiable. The digital image, label, and external sources used to identify the object may be updated by associating them with metadata gathered during the identification process. Subsequent processing is governed by business rules that operate as functions of the label data.

The FDF forwards the information stored in the frame to a destination port, wherein the frame is received within a predetermined number of times, and the destination port.
(actual abstract) A switch unit has one frame buffer pool for storing received frames and another frame buffer pool for storing large frames. The frame size in the large frame buffer pool may be optimized to the largest amount of data the switch unit that an FCoE switching is running on can support (i.e., a limitation of zone entries). Should free space be unavailable in the large frame buffer pool, or if a sequence grows bigger than can be supported, the switch unit may still continue to send response frames back to the sender. While the switch unit may store header information of the frame, the switch unit does not store the data of subsequent frames any longer. Once the sequence has been received completely, a rejection message is sent back with an appropriate error or reason code. The rejection message enables the sender to attempt a retransmission or cancel the current request altogether.

(predicted abstract) A multimedia content search system for searching multimedia content stored on a computer, the system comprising: a database server communicatively coupled to the computer containing one or more databases for storing multimedia content; a search engine program executable by a computer that communicates with the database server and that performs a content search based on the one or more databases; a first user interface executable to display on a display device a first search window that contains one or more search terms, the first search window comprising a first media region containing one or more media files for representing a first media content and a second media region for representing a second media content, the first user interface being operable to receive a first user input selecting a media file contained in the first media region; and a second user interface executable to display on the display device the second media region in response to the first user input, the second user interface being operable to receive a second user input selecting a media file contained in the second media region.
(actual abstract) Techniques described herein enable a service to receive search requests from client systems and perform an integrated search across databases containing informational data for broadcast content and broadband content. The service receives the search request from the client device and formulates a query for at least one broadband database and at least one partner broadcast database. The service queries each broadband database with a compatible query that the service creates using information regarding the type of database queries each partner's database requires. Partners pay the service provider a fee for placing data in the database or for having their database searched by the service. The service formats the data received from the searches of the databases into a user interface screen that is presentable by the client device. The screen information instructs the client device on how it should respond to any key presses by the user.

(predicted abstract) A method, apparatus, and processor-readable medium are provided for generating information to use in an information exchange over a communication network for an application that uses a community having multiple members. Information is obtained from an application of an information provider and sent to an information management system to be provided to individual members via a web pages that are provided by the information management system to the individual members through a web server that has access to a database of the information management system.
(actual abstract) A method and apparatus generate a community based on goals and intentions of its members. Context information related to a first member is collected. A list of goals that the first member wants to accomplish and a list of capabilities that the first member may provide are derived, based on the context information. A search is conducted to find a second member that has at least one of a capability matching at least one goal listed in the list of goals and a goal matching at least one capability listed in the list of capabilities. And then, a community including the first member and the second member is generated.
