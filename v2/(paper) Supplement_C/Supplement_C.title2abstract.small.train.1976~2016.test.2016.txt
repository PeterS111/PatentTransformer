The power meter is galvanically isolated from the electrical conductor through the use of magnetic sensors or through the combination of magnetic sensors and capacitors. Instantaneous power consumed at the load and other desired parameters are determined by measuring the voltage of the load and current flowing through the electrical conductor. Current is measured using a magnetic sensor to detect the magnetic field associated with the current flowing through the electrical conductor. Voltage is measured by one of two possible techniques involving magnetic sensors to measure the current flowing through a coil connected in parallel with a load, or through the use of a capacitively coupled voltage divider connected in parallel with the load. An application specific integrated circuit is further disclosed that controls the bias currents of the sensors for autoranging purposes and also for computing desired parameters, such as power consumption.

Disposing projections of touch sensing electrodes on the array substrate in areas where common electrodes are may reduce right opposite areas between touch sensing electrodes and touch driving electrodes, thereby reduce opposite capacitance; providing sides of touch driving electrodes and adjacent sides of common electrodes as broken lines and providing consistent shapes for touch sensing electrodes and common electrodes may increase opposite areas between touch driving electrodes and touch sensing electrodes, thereby increasing projection capacitance per unit area. By increasing the proportion of projection capacitance over opposite capacitance, it is possible to increase proportion of variation amount of mutual capacitance caused by finger touching, and hence improving the touch accuracy.

(predicted abstract) A polycrystalline, amorphous, amorphous alloy or a metal alloy thin film, transparent, electrically conducting, transparent to light radiation, contains silver in a matrix of crystalline, amorphous or amorphous, and amorphous phase in powder form with the metal in an amount sufficient to produce an electric field across the metal alloy thereby providing an amorphous, amorphous, or amorphous phase and a highly crystalline phase of metal oxide in a thin, opaque layer on a transparent conductor, the thin amorphous phase and the transparent amorphous phase in powder form forming a three-phase, thin layer on a layer of transparent amorphous, amorphous or amorphous phase containing said transparent semiconductor, and being selected to give the thin film thin electrical conductivity.
(actual abstract) This invention is directed to a polymer thick film transparent conductor composition that may be used in applications where thermoforming of the base substrate occurs, e.g., as in capacitive switches. Polycarbonate substrates are often used as the substrate and the polymer thick film conductive composition may be used without any barrier layer. Depending on the specific design, the thermoformable transparent conductor may be below or on top of a thermoformable silver conductor. Thermoformable electric circuits benefit from the presence of an encapsulant layer over the dried polymer thick film transparent conductor composition. The electrical circuit may be subsequently subjected to an injection molding process.

(actual abstract) A cured in place liner system and associated connections and methods are disclosed. The cured in place pipe system forms a completely rehabilitated, stand-alone, fluid-tight flow path between upstream and downstream portions of an existing pipe system. The rehabilitated flow path is stand-alone in that the liner system does not rely on structure of the portion of the pipe system through which the liner system is installed to define the fluid-tight flow path. The flow path between upstream and downstream portions of the liner system is defined by and made fluid-tight solely by components of the rehabilitation system such as cured in place liners and couplers. The portion of the pipe system through which the rehabilitation system is installed merely provides a path (e.g., through the ground) through which the cured in place liner system can be inserted. After the cured in place liner system is installed, the liner system forms a fluid-tight flow path between an upstream portion of the pipe system and a downstream portion of the pipe system. Various types of connections may be used. In addition, various types of methods may be used in forming the connections, such as using a mold to cure connecting sections of the cured in place liners in desired configurations (e.g., having a generally circular outer profile) for forming connections with the liners.

(actual abstract) A method and apparatus for reconfiguring hardware structures to pipeline the execution of multiple special purpose hardware implemented functions, without saving intermediate results to memory, is provided. Pipelining functions in a program is typically performed by a first function saving its results (the &#x201c;intermediate results&#x201d;) to memory, and a second function subsequently accessing the memory to use the intermediate results as input. Saving and accessing intermediate results stored in memory incurs a heavy performance penalty, requires more power, consumes more memory bandwidth, and increases the memory footprint. Due to the ability to redirect the input and output of the hardware structures, intermediate results are passed directly from one special purpose hardware implemented function to another without storing the intermediate results in memory. Consequently, a program that utilizes the method or apparatus, reduces power consumption, consumes less memory bandwidth, and reduces the program's memory footprint.

(actual abstract) Present invention provides a high-precision pressure sampling head used in a Pitot tube flow sensor. The pressure sampling head includes a cylindrical pressure sampling head body. The cylindrical pressure sampling head body contains a total pressure channel and a static pressure channel. The axis of the total pressure channel and the axis of the static pressure channel are parallel to the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Two inclined surfaces are formed on two opposite sides of the lower end of the cylindrical pressure sampling body. A first inclined surface intersects with the total pressure channel and thus a total pressure sensing hole is formed on the first inclined surface. A second inclined surface intersects with the static pressure channel and thus a static pressure sensing hole is formed on the second inclined surface. An angle &#x3b1; formed between the first inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body is smaller than the angle &#x3b2; formed between the second inclined surface and the axis of the cylindrical pressure sampling head body. Based on experimental results, when measuring the volume flow rate of a liquid in a pipe or conduit using the pressure sampling head according to the present invention, the fluid can flow stably through the pressure sampling head, with a high differential pressure between the total pressure sensing hole and the static pressure sensing hole. Thus, a pressure differential measuring device can more easily collect the data and achieve a higher precision of measurement. The measurement precision class can reach between 0.2-0.5.

(predicted abstract) A method for predicting instruction execution in an instruction processing environment includes generating a first prediction of at least one instruction from a first set of instructions prior to executing the at least one instruction, and generating a second prediction of the at least one instruction from a second set of instructions following the first set of instructions prior to executing the at least one instruction. At least a portion of the first prediction and at least a portion of the second prediction may be stored in memory.
(actual abstract) A microprocessor processes conditional non-branch instructions that specify a condition and instruct the microprocessor to perform an operation if the condition is satisfied and otherwise to not perform the operation. A predictor provides a prediction about a conditional non-branch instruction. An instruction translator translates the conditional non-branch instruction into a no-operation microinstruction when the prediction predicts the condition will not be satisfied, and into a set of one or more microinstructions to unconditionally perform the operation when the prediction predicts the condition will be satisfied. An execution pipeline executes the no-operation microinstruction or the set of microinstructions. The predictor translates into a second set of one or more microinstructions to conditionally perform the operation when the prediction does not make a prediction. In the case of a misprediction, the translator re-translates the conditional non-branch instruction into the second set of microinstructions.

(predicted abstract) A method for removing photoresist is provided that includes forming a first oxide layer above a substrate; forming a first polymer layer in contact with the first oxide layer; forming a second oxide layer above the substrate; forming a second polymer layer in contact with the second oxide layer; removing a selected portion of the second oxide layer while retaining the first polymer layer; and removing a remaining portion of the first oxide layer.
(actual abstract) Techniques disclosed herein include increasing pattern density for creating high-resolution contact openings, slots, trenches, and other features. A conformal spacer is applied on a bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel (multi-layer) or other relief feature. The conformal spacer thus wraps around the mandrels and is also deposited on an underlying layer. A fill material is deposited to fill gaps or spaces between sidewall spacers. A CMP planarization step then removes substrate stack material down to a material interface of the bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel, with a middle or lower material of the mandrel being a CMP-stop material. This technique essentially cuts off or removes rounded features such as upper portions of sidewall spacers, thereby providing a spacer material with a planar top surface that can be uniformly etched and transferred to underlying layers.

(predicted abstract) A method is described for preparation of epoxy-clay nanocomposites, in particular anhydrous polymethylmethacrylate nanocomposites. The method comprises anionically polymerizing and/or anhydride polymerizing an epoxy compound, in a solvent. The method includes preparing a monomer mixture comprising a monomer and an alkali anhydride having hydrazide-reactive groups, in which this monomer mixture comprises at least 5 mol % of the alkyl ester of the alkaloyl anhydride of an alkali metal, and in which this monomer mixture contains at least 10 mol % of all of the alkyl ester of the alkaloyl anhydride of an alkali metal, as well as optionally a cross-linking agent, while maintaining the alkali anhydride of the alkali metal until the monomer mixture is at least partially converted into the epoxy-clay nanocomposite. The method is useful to prepare a coating composition, which comprises a polymerizing component A and an epoxy resin component B having hydrazide functionality, which have a cross-linked polymeric skeleton and a hydrophilic portion. The methods are especially useful for preparing nanostructured coating compositions. The coated compositions can be utilized directly or in a powder coating process for preparing thin-film magnetic media.
(actual abstract) The method for the preparation of epoxy-clay nanocomposites uses high shear mixing of Nanomer I.30 E nanoclay into the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy by optimization of high shear mixing speeds, mixing times and degassing temperature. The results showed that the optimum high shear mixing speed and mixing time for optimal clay dispersion were 6000 rpm and 60 min, respectively. Increasing the degassing temperature from 65&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. for the first two hours of the degassing process enhanced nanoclay dispersion, resulting in nanocomposites with a morphology dominated by disorder intercalation with some exfoliated structure. This enhancement in nanocomposite morphology can be attributed to the improvement in epoxy diffusion into the intergallery spacing between clay layers due to temperature rise.

(actual abstract) An automated irrigation purge system utilizes a pressure purge method of discharging compressed air from a reservoir through selected irrigation zones with feedback from pressure switches to determine when to open and close each zone valve. No programming or user interaction is required beyond starting the system. The system can operate with a wide variety of irrigation systems, with varying number of zones, pipe lengths, pipe diameters, number and variety of sprinkler heads or outlets, and terrain slope. The system tracks the pressure transition time from high pressure to low pressure for each zone as it is blown out. When the current transition time is within a specified range from the previous transition time, the system knows the water has been sufficiently purged from that zone. The purge system can protect the irrigation system from high-pressure conditions, handle multiple error conditions, and maintain water valve settings during power loss.

The single sensor is used in time measurement in the context of a distributed sensor network that includes a plurality of network nodes each of which receives data from the other network nodes in the network and provides feedback to a local controller in the network. The local controller outputs control signals to a network management system. The network management system determines whether the system is operational on the basis of the data received from the single sensor. When the system is not operational, the local controller transmits data to the single sensor for a time measurement, the local controller transmits the control signals to the network management system, and the network management system determines whether the system is operational using the control signals from the local controller. In this way, the network management system receives and processes the transmitted signals directly from the local controller.

(actual abstract) A pressure compensation system for enclosed spaces at a subterranean location changes volume with thermally induced solubility changes of a salt in water. The salt is held in an enclosure that is either rigid, or impervious and flexible or porous and flexible. As well conditions change and temperature increases, some of the salt goes into solution with a resulting decrease in volume that compensates for thermally induced volume increase due to temperature increase in the borehole. Conversely, a decrease in borehole temperature brings some of the salt out of solution for a volume increase to offset the volume decrease of the adjacent fluid to keep the pressure stabilized in the enclosed volume. In the porous enclosure embodiment the openings are sufficiently small to retain the salt even in solution. However, minimal net flows are anticipated for pressure compensation due to changing thermal effects.

(actual abstract) Thermally processed fruits and vegetables are softer in texture than fresh. It is challenging to obtain acceptable texture from thermally processed IQF fruits and vegetables. The soaking method of the invention enhances the texture of high quality IQF fruits and vegetables before thermal processing resulting in a processed, shelf-stable fruit or vegetable product with significantly improved texture. When compared to other traditional firming methods using calcium salts added directly to the pack medium or finished product, or using a food enzyme, such as pectinmethylesterase (PME), the soaking method yields fruit and vegetable products with significantly better post-cook textures. Using this method will also enable manufacturers of shelf-stable fruit and vegetable products to use IQF ingredients in continuous year-round production.

A virtual data transfer is initiated between the local head and remote destination over a fibre channel. A virtual data transfer request is received over the fibre channel and a response is sent from the local head to the remote destination. The virtual data transfer request includes information indicating a transmission bandwidth available; and a bandwidth of the fibre channel that would be available if the virtual data transfer has been initiated. The transmission bandwidth available from the local head and remote destination is set as a maximum transmission bandwidth for the response over the fibre channel that would be available if the virtual data transfer has been initiated.
(actual abstract) A switch unit has one frame buffer pool for storing received frames and another frame buffer pool for storing large frames. The frame size in the large frame buffer pool may be optimized to the largest amount of data the switch unit that an FCoE switching is running on can support (i.e., a limitation of zone entries). Should free space be unavailable in the large frame buffer pool, or if a sequence grows bigger than can be supported, the switch unit may still continue to send response frames back to the sender. While the switch unit may store header information of the frame, the switch unit does not store the data of subsequent frames any longer. Once the sequence has been received completely, a rejection message is sent back with an appropriate error or reason code. The rejection message enables the sender to attempt a retransmission or cancel the current request altogether.
