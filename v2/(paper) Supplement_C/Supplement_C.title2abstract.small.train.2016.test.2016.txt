(predicted abstract) Disclosed is a device including an upper substrate; a lower substrate opposite to the lower substrate; a liquid crystal layer disposed between the upper substrate and the lower substrate; a touch electrode disposed on the upper substrate; a sensor-connected part disposed at a peripheral area of at least one of the upper substrate and the lower substrate and configured to detect a touch input; and a wiring electrically connected to the touch electrode and disposed at at least one of the upper substrate and the lower substrate configured to transmit the touch input detected by the sensor-connected part.
(actual abstract) In a capacitive in-cell touch screen and a display device, the common electrode layer connected in the entire surface in the array substrate is divided to form touch driving electrodes and common electrodes which are insulated from each other and alternatively disposed, touch sensing electrodes are disposed on the upper substrate and touch driving electrodes are driven in a time-division manner to realize touch function and display function. Disposing projections of touch sensing electrodes on the array substrate in areas where common electrodes are may reduce right opposite areas between touch sensing electrodes and touch driving electrodes, thereby reduce opposite capacitance; providing sides of touch driving electrodes and adjacent sides of common electrodes as broken lines and providing consistent shapes for touch sensing electrodes and common electrodes may increase opposite areas between touch driving electrodes and touch sensing electrodes, thereby increasing projection capacitance per unit area. By increasing the proportion of projection capacitance over opposite capacitance, it is possible to increase proportion of variation amount of mutual capacitance caused by finger touching, and hence improving the touch accuracy.

The method comprises identifying a plurality of groups of nodes where nodes in the plurality of groups of nodes have a degree of connection in the online network; assigning an initial trust level to each node of the plurality of groups of nodes where the initial trust level of each node is assigned to a second node; determining a trust level for each node of the plurality of groups of nodes where the trust level of each node is assigned to a third node in the plurality of groups of nodes for each node of the plurality of groups of nodes; and storing the trust levels for the plurality of groups of nodes based on the initial trust levels of the plurality of nodes in the set of nodes in the set of nodes.
(actual abstract) Methods are provided for constructing an on-the-fly circle of trust for a user of an online social network to enable the user to reduce the likelihood that information will be leaked to an unwanted target. In one embodiment, a maximum circle of trust is constructed by using an iterative greedy construction (IGC) algorithm with leakage estimation using disjoint cut-sets. In another embodiment, the maximum circle of trust is constructed by using the IGC algorithm with leakage estimation using a hybrid method where the initial CT is constructed using the disjoint cut-sets and then the neighbors not included in the CT are sorted in non-decreasing order of visibilities and then each of these neighbors is included in the CT one at a time while checking if the leakage is below a threshold using a Sampling algorithm. In yet another embodiment, randomized rounding is used to construct the maximum circle of trust.

The coating is applied by applying a polyvinyl chloride-based resin to at least part of the surface, after the resin is cured, in such a way that the resin at least partially covering the surface is coated with a layer of a different material than the thickness of the layer of the resin on the basis of a cross section of the coating.
(actual abstract) A cured in place liner system and associated connections and methods are disclosed. The cured in place pipe system forms a completely rehabilitated, stand-alone, fluid-tight flow path between upstream and downstream portions of an existing pipe system. The rehabilitated flow path is stand-alone in that the liner system does not rely on structure of the portion of the pipe system through which the liner system is installed to define the fluid-tight flow path. The flow path between upstream and downstream portions of the liner system is defined by and made fluid-tight solely by components of the rehabilitation system such as cured in place liners and couplers. The portion of the pipe system through which the rehabilitation system is installed merely provides a path (e.g., through the ground) through which the cured in place liner system can be inserted. After the cured in place liner system is installed, the liner system forms a fluid-tight flow path between an upstream portion of the pipe system and a downstream portion of the pipe system. Various types of connections may be used. In addition, various types of methods may be used in forming the connections, such as using a mold to cure connecting sections of the cured in place liners in desired configurations (e.g., having a generally circular outer profile) for forming connections with the liners.

In addition to providing the gender-selectable combination of the upper and lower bands for transmit and receive, this topology allows for the selection of transmit, and receive polarizations. A transceiver may transmit and receive on the same or on orthogonal polarizations. Paired transceivers may transmit on the same or on orthogonal polarizations. This is accomplished by integrating a rotatable polarizer (e.g. a &#xbc; wave plate) and a polarization duplexer (e.g. an orthomode transducer) in a FDD (Frequency-Domain Duplexed) system. The rotatable polarizer allows for selection of both transmit and receive bands and polarizations.

(actual abstract) The present disclosure is directed to an ion mobility drift tube fabricated using flex-circuit technology in which every other drift electrode is on a different layer of the flex-circuit and each drift electrode partially overlaps the adjacent electrodes on the other layer. This results in a self-shielding effect where the drift electrodes themselves shield the interior of the drift tube from unwanted electro-magnetic noise. In addition, this drift tube can be manufactured with an integral flex-heater for temperature control. This design will significantly improve the noise immunity, size, weight, and power requirements of hand-held ion mobility systems such as those used for explosive detection.

(actual abstract) A method and apparatus for reconfiguring hardware structures to pipeline the execution of multiple special purpose hardware implemented functions, without saving intermediate results to memory, is provided. Pipelining functions in a program is typically performed by a first function saving its results (the &#x201c;intermediate results&#x201d;) to memory, and a second function subsequently accessing the memory to use the intermediate results as input. Saving and accessing intermediate results stored in memory incurs a heavy performance penalty, requires more power, consumes more memory bandwidth, and increases the memory footprint. Due to the ability to redirect the input and output of the hardware structures, intermediate results are passed directly from one special purpose hardware implemented function to another without storing the intermediate results in memory. Consequently, a program that utilizes the method or apparatus, reduces power consumption, consumes less memory bandwidth, and reduces the program's memory footprint.

Based on experimental results, when measuring the volume flow rate of a liquid in a pipe or conduit using the pressure sampling head according to the present invention, the fluid can flow stably through the pressure sampling head, with a high differential pressure between the total pressure sensing hole and the static pressure sensing hole. Thus, a pressure differential measuring device can more easily collect the data and achieve a higher precision of measurement. The measurement precision class can reach between 0.2-0.5.

(actual abstract) Techniques disclosed herein include increasing pattern density for creating high-resolution contact openings, slots, trenches, and other features. A conformal spacer is applied on a bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel (multi-layer) or other relief feature. The conformal spacer thus wraps around the mandrels and is also deposited on an underlying layer. A fill material is deposited to fill gaps or spaces between sidewall spacers. A CMP planarization step then removes substrate stack material down to a material interface of the bi-layer or tri-layer mandrel, with a middle or lower material of the mandrel being a CMP-stop material. This technique essentially cuts off or removes rounded features such as upper portions of sidewall spacers, thereby providing a spacer material with a planar top surface that can be uniformly etched and transferred to underlying layers.

Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of an epoxy-clay and/or nanoparticles in a single step to make epoxy-clay and/or nanoparticles containing one or more amine functions.
(actual abstract) The method for the preparation of epoxy-clay nanocomposites uses high shear mixing of Nanomer I.30 E nanoclay into the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy by optimization of high shear mixing speeds, mixing times and degassing temperature. The results showed that the optimum high shear mixing speed and mixing time for optimal clay dispersion were 6000 rpm and 60 min, respectively. Increasing the degassing temperature from 65&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. for the first two hours of the degassing process enhanced nanoclay dispersion, resulting in nanocomposites with a morphology dominated by disorder intercalation with some exfoliated structure. This enhancement in nanocomposite morphology can be attributed to the improvement in epoxy diffusion into the intergallery spacing between clay layers due to temperature rise.

(actual abstract) This invention involves a method of securing pipe (also referred to as a &#x201c;string of tools&#x201d;) when driving off a subsea well or sealing off a well in onshore applications where there is an emergency by grabbing the pipe before it is cut. A pipe ram then is closed on the pipe before a shear ram is actuated to cut the pipe. In subsea applications, the top of the pipe may then be raised clear of the blowout preventer within a marine riser. A blind ram and annular preventer can then be closed above the remnant of the pipe being retained by the pipe catcher. The pipe above the cut is removed through the marine riser and the marine riser itself is then disconnected. The rig is then driven off the well. If the well is reactivated the steps are reversed but the well is safely secured before the blowout preventer components are opened. The pipe supported by the catcher is independently supported before the catcher is released and the pipe lifted through the riser.

(actual abstract) Various embodiments enable a primary user to be identified and tracked using stereo association and multiple tracking algorithms. For example, a face detection algorithm can be run on each image captured by a respective camera independently. Stereo association can be performed to match faces between cameras. If the faces are matched and a primary user is determined, a face pair is created and used as the first data point in memory for initializing object tracking. Further, features of a user's face can be extracted and the change in position of these features between images can determine what tracking method will be used for that particular frame.

(actual abstract) A pressure compensation system for enclosed spaces at a subterranean location changes volume with thermally induced solubility changes of a salt in water. The salt is held in an enclosure that is either rigid, or impervious and flexible or porous and flexible. As well conditions change and temperature increases, some of the salt goes into solution with a resulting decrease in volume that compensates for thermally induced volume increase due to temperature increase in the borehole. Conversely, a decrease in borehole temperature brings some of the salt out of solution for a volume increase to offset the volume decrease of the adjacent fluid to keep the pressure stabilized in the enclosed volume. In the porous enclosure embodiment the openings are sufficiently small to retain the salt even in solution. However, minimal net flows are anticipated for pressure compensation due to changing thermal effects.

The VFR utility then determines the actual expected delay based on a deep inspection of packet headers. The VFR utility utilizes a processing opportunity delay (which determines whether the E2E delay tolerance is greater than the actual expected delay) to reprocess video content comprising Intra-coded (I) pictures/frames and Predicted (P) frames to improve compression efficiency. The VFR utility may also utilize a complexity ratio which is a ratio of the I-Frame rate and the P-Frame rate to select frames for compression. The VFR utility recompresses video content by replacing P-Frames with B-Frames.

(actual abstract) Thermally processed fruits and vegetables are softer in texture than fresh. It is challenging to obtain acceptable texture from thermally processed IQF fruits and vegetables. The soaking method of the invention enhances the texture of high quality IQF fruits and vegetables before thermal processing resulting in a processed, shelf-stable fruit or vegetable product with significantly improved texture. When compared to other traditional firming methods using calcium salts added directly to the pack medium or finished product, or using a food enzyme, such as pectinmethylesterase (PME), the soaking method yields fruit and vegetable products with significantly better post-cook textures. Using this method will also enable manufacturers of shelf-stable fruit and vegetable products to use IQF ingredients in continuous year-round production.

(predicted abstract) A data stream in a virtualized fibre channel over ethernet (FCoE) data forwarder is received from an application layer port at a FCoE data forwarder link aggregation device. The virtualized fibre channel is a channel over ethernet (FCoE) data stream in an ethernet fabric. The receive data stream is forwarded over the ethernet, and the data stream is processed by a stream analyzer from the application layer port. An ethernet port is associated with the stream analyzer. The processing includes generating a request to a local data source, selecting a first data stream to provide data to the local data source, sending the request to the local data source, and receiving the data stream at the local data source. The data stream is sent over either the ethernet port, the local data source, or the local data source.
(actual abstract) A switch unit has one frame buffer pool for storing received frames and another frame buffer pool for storing large frames. The frame size in the large frame buffer pool may be optimized to the largest amount of data the switch unit that an FCoE switching is running on can support (i.e., a limitation of zone entries). Should free space be unavailable in the large frame buffer pool, or if a sequence grows bigger than can be supported, the switch unit may still continue to send response frames back to the sender. While the switch unit may store header information of the frame, the switch unit does not store the data of subsequent frames any longer. Once the sequence has been received completely, a rejection message is sent back with an appropriate error or reason code. The rejection message enables the sender to attempt a retransmission or cancel the current request altogether.
