In the context of a volume snapshot which may involve (i) taking virtual machine snapshots of all virtual machines associated with the volume, (ii) taking the volume snapshot, and (iii) removing all the virtual machine snapshots, the virtual machine snapshots may be created in a first order and removed in a second order. Specifically, snapshots for busy virtual machines (i.e., virtual machines with higher disk write activity) may be created last and removed first.

One level detector is a multichannel analog-to-digital converter. The other level detector is a multichannel digital-to-analog converter. A switch sequentially selects the output of the two level detector circuit. An alarm circuit is powered by the levels of the output of the level detector circuit selected by the switch. A second alarm circuit, also powered by the output of the level detector circuit selected by the switch, provides an alarm signal at the outputs of the level detector circuit selected by the switch, when the outputs of the first and second level detectors are at the same voltage level. Each level detector output signal corresponds to the maximum or minimum voltage level of the output voltage of the capacitive level detector. The level sensor provides an output level signal for each level detector output signal, each level signal being determined by comparing the output voltage of that level sensor output with the threshold voltage of its respective level detector output signal. A switch allows the output of one level detector to be selected prior to selecting the output of the other level detector. The switch allows the output from the one level detector to be reset when its respective output signal is no longer at the threshold voltage of the other level detector. This allows the first and second level detection circuits to be reset prior to a reset from one sensor to the next when each output voltage of the level detectors are at the same level. The first level detector output signal is ""1"" when its output signal is at the lowest voltage level of the second level detector. The second level detector output signal is ""0"" when its output signal is at the highest voltage level of the second level detector. The second level sensor output signal is ""1"" when its output signal is at the lowest or highest level of the second level detector.

(actual abstract) A wellbore cementing tool configured for placement in a wellbore or in a drill string, and method of using same. The tool comprises a body having upper and lower members connected by a shear component. A rod is connected to the upper member, and the tool can be lowered with the rod into the wellbore or drill string to a desired depth. At the desired depth, locking means are deployed to lock the tool in position, the tool is sealed, and cement can be injected through the tool to the annulus of the outer casing. In some embodiments the tool is locked using a pushing motion that extends locking members outwardly from the tool to engage the wellbore walls or the inner surfaces of the drill string. Once cementing is completed, the rod is pulled from surface thereby causing the shear component to rupture and the upper and lower members to disconnect, and the upper member can be drawn to surface leaving the rest of the tool downhole. The tool does not require rotation to recover the rod, hence reducing the risk of loosening the threaded connections of lengths of drill pipe.

(predicted abstract) Methods and devices for sequencing the nucleotide sequence of a mixture of nucleic acids are disclosed. The method and device include a nucleic acid sample comprising a mixture of nucleic acids. The mixture of nucleic acids may include multiple different nucleic acids or nucleic acids complementary to different nucleic acids. An energy transfer sensor is used adapted to detect energy transfer from the nucleic acid sample. The nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid sample is determined based on the energy transfer. The method of the invention employs a single molecule nucleic acid sequence. The method and device of the invention provide an efficient and sensitive sequence identification method where multiple nucleic acid regions are processed simultaneously.
(actual abstract) Provided herein are systems and methods for nucleotide incorporation reactions. The systems comprise polymerases having altered nucleotide incorporation kinetics and are linked to an energy transfer donor moiety, and nucleotide molecules linked with at least one energy transfer acceptor moiety. The donor and acceptor moieties undergo energy transfer when the polymerase and nucleotide are proximal to each other during nucleotide binding and/or nucleotide incorporation. As the donor and acceptor moieties undergo energy transfer, they generate an energy transfer signal which can be associated with nucleotide binding or incorporation. Detecting a time sequence of the generated signals, or the change in the signals, can be used to determine the order of the incorporated nucleotides, and can therefore be used to deduce the sequence of the target molecule.

(predicted abstract) A method and apparatus for providing a wireless service are disclosed. A base station (BS) generates a service request to a target station (STS) to provide a service. Each of the STS and the BS is assigned a unique resource block (RAB) which defines a transmission time interval (TTI) for transmitting the service. The BS determines whether or not the target station has the service through an inter-nodal channel. If the target station has the service through the inter-nodal channel, the MS transmits a synchronization frame (SM) to the target station in an initial stage of a transmission time interval (TTI) of the RAB assigned. If the target station does not have the service through the inter-nodal channel, a frame of the STS is transmitted to the target station in an end stage of the same RAB within the same RRI. The service will be transmitted during the same RRI with a same SRS.
(actual abstract) The disclosure generally relates to optimized always-on wireless service using network assistance and keep-alives. More particularly, in response to a user equipment (UE) requesting a bearer for an always-on service, a network may establish the bearer for the always-on service and transmit an availability time that indicates a period during which the bearer will be held in an active state to the UE. Any applications running on the UE may then use the bearer for the always-on service, and the UE may transmit a single keep-alive message to the network before the availability time expires to reset the period during which the bearer will be held in the active state. Furthermore, the keep-alive message may be structured to not generate a reply and thereby reduce battery consumption, reduce communication overhead, and improve network capacity.

(predicted abstract) A method is proposed by means of which a slave clock is synchronized to a master clock based on characteristics of the pulses of clock signals that are transmitted by the slave clock to the master clock. By utilizing the method, a synchronization time of the slave clock with the master clock can be determined in a simple manner, from the clock-signal characteristics of the clock pulses. In particular, it is proposed that the slave clock also transmit data signals, the clock-signal characteristics of which are measured by the master clock, which data signals are synchronized to the clock pulses of the slave clock, and that, by means of the correlation of the clock pulses that are transmitted by the slave clock to the data signals that are synchronized with the clock pulses of the master clock, a timing difference between the data signals and the clock pulses which is associated therewith is determined.
(actual abstract) Methods, media, and systems are provided for characterizing the synchronization behavior of a slave clock. A sequence of sync packets, usable to synchronize with a grandmaster clock, is transmitted from the grandmaster clock to a slave clock. The sequence of sync packets is modified by dropping one or more sync packets from the sequence, providing a pattern of dropped sync packets. A synchronization output of the slave clock is monitored and, based on the synchronization output, a determination is made as to whether the slave clock is synchronized while the sequence of sync packets is modified. A characterization of the synchronization behavior of the slave clock is stored with respect to the pattern of dropped sync packets. The process may be repeated for various patterns of dropped sync packets.

(actual abstract) A host system recognizes a sample pretreatment system at which a primary sample has first arrived and records the information, if multiple containers containing the primary sample are input. Upon issuing an analysis request to the sample pretreatment system, the host system determines whether the primary sample (sample bearing the same barcode for sample identification) is input to a system different from the system to which the sample was input for the first time and, if that is the case, then determines that &#x201c;the sample is input to the wrong system&#x201d; and issues a &#x201c;do-nothing request&#x201d; (request to do nothing) so that an aliquoting operation will not be performed. Given the &#x201c;do-nothing request&#x201d; from the host system, the sample pretreatment system does not prepare any aliquot sample and places the input sample onto a tray in a predetermined position.

In particular, the present invention includes an electronic level detection station that utilizes a magnet to produce a magnetic field which is directed toward a predetermined location within the interior of a building, at various locations about its perimeter, such location being designated as a ""detect"" location. As the magnet passes through the building, it produces a magnetic field which is directed toward the detection location. Furthermore, the level detection station produces a level detection signal indicating the position of the magnet relative to the detection location. As the magnet passes out of the interior of the building, it produces a magnetic field which is directed to the predetermined location within the interior of the building. Furthermore, a processor within the level detection station determines the actual water level based on the magnetic field and the level detection signal, and provides a control signal in response thereto. A controller is adapted to connect the level detection signal to the controller, receive the control signal, and move a movable barrier into an opening in the building interior to allow the magnet to pass therethrough, such movement being determined by a control signal. After the magnet has passed through a building interior location, the controller can either automatically move the movable barrier or allow the magnet to pass through the stationary building location in order to produce a level detection signal, which indicates to the processor the position of the magnet with respect to a predetermined level of water in the building interior. Since the magnet is spaced from the monitoring location, the processor can provide an indication of a desired level of water of the building interior based upon the position of the magnet as well as the position of the barrier.

(predicted abstract) A low-cost chromatic tunable waveguide filter is formed as two optical waveguides. A first optical waveguide includes, at least one optical cavity having an electrical cavity loss value to support propagation of optical signals in a predetermined wavelength range, preferably using a Bragg grating. An input optical signal into the first optical waveguide causes a cavity-induced strain which imparts to the first optical waveguide a stress in the region of the optical cavity due to the cavity loss. The optical cavity of the first optical waveguide has an optical cavity length so the optical cavity strain of the first optical waveguide causes a strain in a region of the first optical waveguide adjacent the optical cavity. A second optical waveguide is positioned with the first optical waveguide and has a second optical waveguide fiber. A tunable optical cavity is formed in the second optical waveguide and is electrically biased to cause cavity-induced stresses of opposite types in opposite directions in the second optical waveguide. The tunable cavity of the second waveguide has a length so the cavity length in the second optical waveguide causes a strain in a region of the second optical waveguide adjacent the tunable optical cavity. The optical fiber has a reflectivity in the predetermined band; for example, in a band of 1.0 to 2.0 nm.

After a number of the sheets of filter material have been positioned in a manner with at least the edges of adjacent sheets of filter material contiguous, the two-dimensional configuration is formed into a honeycomb structure with cells extending in the longitudinal direction of the element. A layer (14) of permeable material is positioned at least partially between opposed faces of the stack of filter material. The permeable material forms one or more outer layers of the element, the cell walls of which define the open interior of the honeycomb. After an external fluid to be filtered is added to the open interior, the fluid passes through the permeable material and flows out of the open interior. Since the cells that extend in the longitudinal direction of the structure are filled with the permeable material, the flow rate of the fluid that passes through the permeable material are approximately 20 m/min. This results in a filtering effect and a reduction of the flow resistance of the device.

(predicted abstract) Methods and apparatus are disclosed for a vehicle to indicate a collision avoidance system is not active. To this end, the vehicle's location is determined using an electronic system that calculates the relative speed with which the vehicle moves at the instant the vehicle leaves the region in which it is desired to operate as a non-transition avoidance system. The vehicle's speed is compared with a predetermined range to determine if the vehicle is traveling in a direction appropriate to avoid a collision; the system determines the appropriate action to be taken in which the vehicle is to avoid a collision; and, if the system determines that the vehicle is traveling in the appropriate direction, the system can be used to indicate that the vehicle can be returned to the region where it is desired to operate as a non-transition avoidance system.
(actual abstract) A system and method for suppressing collision warning in a host vehicle is provided. The system receives position data from a remote vehicle. The host vehicle suppresses a collision warning when a detected stationary object is in a safe-zone based on the remote vehicle position data, thereby preventing false collision warnings.

(predicted abstract) A system, apparatus and method for a vertical satellite positioning system (VPS) which utilizes vehicle navigation data and positioning data from GPS stations located within a selected range to determine an aircraft's position and trajectory and provides vehicle position information to the aircraft without additional hardware and logic for GPS time tracking. In a first embodiment the system utilizes a GPS satellite to provide an indication in the form of a VPS signal which serves as a common reference when the VPS signal is received on the same satellite used by the navigation station and on a different satellite. A time of flight (TOF) receiver on the GPS satellite tracks the satellite position, and in this case, provides the time of flight information to the vehicle to enable precise position estimates to be obtained. In the second embodiment, the system is used by a navigation station to provide an indication in the form of an electronic signal for a GPS satellite. The navigation station provides the time of flight information to the vehicle to enable precise position estimates to be obtained. In this instance, the user of the vehicle can use the vehicle's GPS receiver to determine the amount of time and the time difference between the vehicle's arrival at a selected time on the same satellite as the GPS satellite. For example, if the user is a stationary aircraft, the GPS station would be stationary and be used to determine the arrival time of the GPS satellite. In the third embodiment, the navigation station can provide a time of flight data and vehicle position information to the aircraft for a selected time period, and this time of flight data and vehicle position information would be used for accurate position estimates to be obtained.

(predicted abstract) A system and method for collision avoidance in a vehicle utilizes an approach to detecting vehicle collision and preventing collision avoidance when vehicles are in a state of collision. In one embodiment, first and second sensors, or sensors, provide an input signal that is supplied to an electronic computer that calculates an optimum collision avoidance setting based upon a model of traffic of a path by which the vehicle is to exit the path. A collision avoidance algorithm is stored in the computer memory with each algorithm having one or more parameters that can be associated with one of a plurality of possible collision avoidance settings. When the vehicle is not within the path of a given model, the computer calculates a new optimum collision avoidance setting from one or more of the one or more parameters for the given model. When the vehicle is beyond the path of the given model, the computer performs a predetermined algorithm to set the optimum collision avoidance as the calculated collision avoidance setting. Upon receiving a vehicle collision signal, the electronic computer compares the collision signal to the calculated collision avoidance setting and, based upon a successful comparison, the electronic computer changes the predetermined algorithm of the stored collision avoidance algorithm.

In one embodiment, a digital audio processor (DAA) receives as input a compressed digital signal representing an original signal, a noise signal, and a time-varying signal indicative of signal values between the original signal and the noise signal. The DAA generates as output a compressed digital signal representative of a residual signal by: (1) dividing the digital signal by the time-varying signal to obtain a first time series and a second time series, (2) selecting a value from each of the first and second time series, (3) selecting between every selected value of the first time series and the second time series a value that may be a linear combination of the values selected from the first time series and the first time series, (4) selecting between every selected value of the second time series and the first time series a value that may be a linear combination of the values selected from the second time series and the second time series, and (5) applying a linear combination of the values selected from the first time series and the values selected from the second time series in order to generate the compressed digital signal.
(actual abstract) A new framework for video compressed sensing models the evolution of the image frames of a video sequence as a linear dynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first estimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, from which the image frames are then reconstructed. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic parameters (state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (observation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement strategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and accumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This enables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably yet obtain video recovery at a high frame rate that is in fact inversely proportional to the length of the video sequence. This property makes our framework well-suited for high-speed video capture and other applications. We validate our approach with a range of experiments including classification experiments that highlight the purposive nature of our framework.

(predicted abstract) The present invention provides an assembly having an electrically heated showerhead in which hot air from the showerhead is passed into a plenum between two heat insulating plates. The hot air from the plenum is then passed to the ambient orifice without the hot air heating the showerhead. The heat insulating plates are made from a material that provides a minimal amount of insulating material and, therefore, a minimal amount of heat to the hot air passing to the showerhead.
(actual abstract) The present disclosure generally comprises a heated showerhead assembly that may be used to supply processing gases into a processing chamber. The processing chamber may be an etching chamber. When processing gas is evacuated from the processing chamber, the uniform processing of the substrate may be difficult. As the processing gas is pulled away from the substrate and towards the vacuum pump, the plasma, in the case of etching, may not be uniform across the substrate. Uneven plasma may lead to uneven etching. To prevent uneven etching, the showerhead assembly may be separated into two zones each having independently controllable gas introduction and temperature control. The first zone corresponds to the perimeter of the substrate while the second zone corresponds to the center of the substrate. By independently controlling the temperature and the gas flow through the showerhead zones, etching uniformity of the substrate may be increased.

(predicted abstract) " A method for cleaving a substrate, including the steps of (1) obtaining a substrate having a cleave region and at least one cleave region layer overlying the surface of the substrate; (2) subjecting the substrate to thermal strain; (3) causing the substrate in the cleave region to exhibit a tensile yield stress at least 10 percent greater than a conventional ""cisper "", where the cisper is defined as the difference in (i) the tensile stress at a depth of a cleave region layer from the surface of the substrate at which that layer occurs and (ii) a tensile stress at a depth from the surface of the substrate at which that layer occurs; and (4) subjecting the cleave region to a mechanical stress whereby at least one portion of the cleave region layer is selectively cleaved. The method can be implemented by exposing the substrate to an ultraviolet light beam and a mechanical stress to separate away the cleave region. Preferably, the mechanical stress is applied using ultrasonic or hydraulic energy which has a frequency in a range of about 0.01 to 0.1 MHz. The substrate can comprise silicon, germanium, or III-V materials, including silicon or germanium alloy materials. By virtue thereof, the cleaving method of the invention can be implemented to selectively remove at least a portion of a cleave region layer, for example, for the formation of a quantum well within a device. "
(actual abstract) A thickness of material may be detached from a substrate along a cleave plane, utilizing a cleaving process controlled by a releasable constraint plate. In some embodiments this constraint plate may comprise a plate that can couple side forces (the &#x201c;P-plate&#x201d;) and a thin, softer compliant layer (the &#x201c;S-layer&#x201d;) situated between the P-plate and the substrate. In certain embodiments a porous surface within the releasable constraint plate and in contact to the substrate, allows the constraint plate to be secured to the substrate via a first pressure differential. Application of a combination of a second pressure differential within a pre-existing cleaved portion, and a linear force to a side of the releasable constraint plate bound to the substrate, generates loading that results in controlled cleaving along the cleave plane.

The state machine switches from the first state to the second state when the second portion of the instruction indicates that the first operation is dependent upon the first operation, and from the second state to the first state when the second portion of the instruction indicates that the second operation is dependent upon the first operation to thereby allow the first operation to be determined with a single state machine. The second state is associated with the second operation when it is determined that the first operation is dependent upon the second operation, and the second state is associated with the first operation when it is determined that the first operation is not dependent upon the second operation. The state engine is used to determine the state of the first operation upon being placed in the first state such that it may also be placed in the first state and in the second state. The end of the operation is not the first instruction, thereby allowing the first operation to be determined with the single state engine.
(actual abstract) A conditional instruction end facility is provided that allows completion of an instruction to be delayed. In executing the machine instruction, an operand is obtained, and a determination is made as to whether the operand has a predetermined relationship with respect to a value. Based on determining that the operand does not have the predetermined relationship with respect to the value, the obtaining and the determining are repeated. Based on determining that the operand has the predetermined relationship with respect to the value, execution of the instruction is completed. The obtaining the operand, the determining whether the operand has the predetermined relationship, the based on determining that the operand does not have the predetermined relationship with respect to the value, repeating the obtaining and the determining, and the based on determining that the operand has the predetermined relationship with respect to the value, completing execution of the instruction are performed as part of a single instruction having one operation code.

The application-level system includes a speech recognizer that is configured to perform speech recognition on input speech to identify partial proper names. The application-level system includes a partial proper name engine that is operable to receive a series of input speech and is configured to convert this series of input speech into a series of partial proper names. During use, the partial proper names are presented in the application-level system and are responsive to a series of commands. In one example of speech recognition application-level systems in which the partial proper-address recognition performed by the speech recognizer is responsive to input speech only, the application-level system includes a speech recognition engine which is configured to perform speech recognition upon the input speech and to convert the input speech into a series of partial proper names from the series of input speech.

A partial name is part of the original name, with some words omitted, or word order changed, or even word substitution. After candidate partial names are generated, their phonetic transcriptions are incorporated into a model for a speech recognizer to recognize the partial names in a speech recognition system.

As a transistor provided for each pixel, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer is used. Note that off-state current of the transistor can be decreased when the oxide semiconductor layer is highly purified. Therefore, variation in the value of a data signal due to the off-state current of the transistor can be suppressed. That is, display deterioration (change) which occurs when writing frequency of the data signal to the pixel including the transistor is reduced (when a break period is lengthened) can be suppressed. In addition, flickers in display which generates when the frequency of an alternating-current driving signal supplied to a signal line in the break period is reduced can be suppressed.

(predicted abstract) A power supply control apparatus and system which utilizes a non-conducting contactless power supply for controlling a vehicle-mounted apparatus and can improve safety. The power supply control apparatus has a power supply circuit for controlling a switching element of the power supply circuit by performing an on/off control of the switching element. When a voltage supply condition of a power supply of the vehicle does not satisfy an on/off signal outputted from the power supply system to the power supply circuit, the on/off control of the switching element is performed in an off period of the switching element, and the power supply condition is held even after an off period. Thus, when a voltage supply of the power supply circuit does not satisfy the on/off signal, an on/off control is performed when the voltage of the power supply circuit is reduced to a level below the voltage of the power supply. Thus, the power supply control apparatus can prevent an erroneous detection by an on/off signal while maintaining a constant voltage supply, thereby reducing energy consumption and preventing an electric shock of an electric load, of the power supply system.
(actual abstract) A power supply control apparatus is connected to an electric device to control supply of power to the electric device. The apparatus includes a main power switch to apply or interrupt main power to the electric device, the main power being external input commercial AC power, an auxiliary power storage unit supplied and charged with the main power as auxiliary power, a charging/discharging unit including a charging circuit to convert the main power into DC power and charge the converted DC power in the auxiliary power storage unit, and a discharging circuit to convert the DC power in the auxiliary power storage unit into AC power and discharge the converted AC power to the electric device, and a controller to control the main power switch, and control the charging/discharging unit to selectively drive the charging circuit or the discharging circuit.

(predicted abstract) This invention provides enhanced reality methods for providing real-time interactive virtual objects to a user while an individual is wearing a helmet. A camera captures a user's face in addition to a user's eye. The camera is configured with an image processing software program which displays a face of the user's head in an augmented reality scene and a virtual object in the helmet's view. In the event of an event during which the user is wearing the helmet, the user performs a preprogrammed user action as well. Once the user has performed the event, a determination is made to whether a particular user action is appropriate. If the user action is appropriate, the virtual object is displayed in the augmented reality scene which includes a real object. The user's real object is then moved to a desired location relative to the virtual object and the user's virtual object is displayed in the augmented visualization scene for the user. If the user action is not appropriate, the virtual object is displayed in a real-time view.

(actual abstract) The present invention refers to a system of prosthetic components consisting of Compensatory Slanted Copings and Abutments of Universal Coupling that function as a set of coupled parts that allow corrections of slants that vary between OQ and 60Q, of fixing osseointeg rated implants, including zygomatic fixations, and it provides a cap, molding transferer and screws for fastening and locking. This system of copings and abutments provides properties of conversion and extension of the implants. Its shape provides better occlusal stability and favorable biomechanics, since the forces are better distributed, diminishing the concentration of tension on the fitting platform of the implant, as well as the screws. The abutments of the universal coupling can be readjusted and be cemented or screwed. In the present system, the superior platform of the coping and the inferior base of the abutment are universalized, since the inferior platform of the coping corrects the slant of the implant. It has screws for fastening and for locking of the coping/abutment set. The characteristics of this system provide great versatility, which allows it to be used in various areas of medicine.

(predicted abstract) A microprocessor-controlled linear amplifier in which an input signal is converted into an amplified signal using multiple current source circuits, a first voltage detector which measures the input signal, and a second voltage detector which measures a desired voltage. Based on the difference between the measured input signal and the measured desired voltage, an output voltage which is provided to an amplifier and provides an input voltage to the current source circuits is determined. By measuring the input signal and the desired voltage, the required current source circuits are controlled, thereby maintaining the desired voltage within an acceptable tolerance. The output of the current source circuits, which is dependent upon the difference between the input voltage and an output of the linear amplifier, is also used to determine an error associated with components other than the current source circuits. The error is then used to update the target output voltage to compensate for the error. By using this control scheme, more accurate control of the current source circuits is provided, so that the linear amplifier has the effect of increasing the bandwidth without being affected by other than ambient temperature changes.

(actual abstract) When compiling high-level, graphical code (e.g. LabVIEW&#x2122; code) to a different representation (e.g. different software code or hardware FPGA), information relating to characteristics of the design may be collected/captured from the compilation process, and automatically provided to all the earlier stages of the compilation process to obtain more optimal results. Without automated feedback of this information, users have to manually identify, produce, and provide the feedback information, or forego the process altogether, having to assume that the tool has produced the best possible results when that may not be the case. To correct timing, failed constraints paths may be parsed and compared to delays obtained during a previous compile, and previous adjustments that didn't yield desired results may be undone. The longest delay that didn't result from an undone path may then be identified, and adjusted, and the process may be repeated until all paths are predicted to pass.

(predicted abstract) A new process for making a CMP oxide layer having a thickness less than about 35 angstroms. The new process comprises two sequential steps. First, it provides a low temperature process for converting a CMP oxide layer into an inorganic oxide. Thereafter, after the low temperature process, the CMP layer is treated in a high pressure hydrogen-inert ambient at about 100 to 300 torr for about 5 to 15 minutes to convert the CMP layer into the inorganic oxide. Finally, the inorganic oxide after treatment is etched by a chemical etch using an aqueous HCl-containing etchant using a CMP process that is selective to the oxide layer.
(actual abstract) A method includes forming a dummy gate of a transistor at a surface of a wafer, removing the dummy gate, and filling a metallic material into a trench left by the removed dummy gate.

A first set of image frames associated with the ROI is determined, and from these first set of image frames, the image information for each pixel is determined. If a pixel is on an edge, the pixel is located as a result of the comparison. If another pixel is located outside a boundary of the region of interest, the pixel is added to a second set of image frames. The resulting second image containing pixels corresponding to the first set of image frames and the added pixels is stored.
(actual abstract) Embodiments segment received image data. The received image data may include pixels that have multiple channels of intensity values. The image data is decomposed into albedo and shading components. This may be accomplished using a minimization that enforces a relationship between albedo, shading, and intensity values. The minimization may also include an albedo regularizer to infer albedo in part based on chromaticity and albedo of surrounding pixels. Superpixels are generated based on contiguous regions of pixels having similar image data across channels. These superpixels are then merged based in part on the determined albedo and shading components as well as based on the image data. The channels of image data may include infrared image data used to modify visible channels of the image to create pseudo-image data, which may be used in place of image data for albedo-shading decomposition, superpixel generation, or superpixel merging.

(predicted abstract) An actuator apparatus for use in positioning an instrument to measure the displacement of the instrument as set forth in FIG. 3 is disclosed. The actuator apparatus includes a base, an instrument to be positioned by the actuator apparatus, and a linear motor for coupling the base to the instrument. A linear motion measuring system measures the linear position of the instrument so that the displacement and velocity measurements of the instrument can be determined. The linear motion measuring system includes a plurality of position sensors arranged at fixed locations relative to the base, in particular two position sensors. The actuator further includes a switch for selecting one of the position sensors and a controller which generates a pulse in response to the position sensor selected to be selected. The controller generates a control current signal for controlling the linear motor in response to the control current signal and uses the control current signal to drive the motor.
(actual abstract) Embodiments described herein may take the form of an electromagnetic actuator that produces a haptic output during operation. Generally, an electromagnetic coil is wrapped around a central magnet array. A shaft passes through the central magnet array, such that the central array may move along the shaft when the proper force is applied. When a current passes through the electromagnetic coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. The coil is stationary with respect to a housing of the actuator, while the central magnet array may move along the shaft within the housing. Thus, excitation of the coil exerts a force on the central magnet array, which moves in response to that force. The direction of the current through the coil determines the direction of the magnetic field and thus the motion of the central magnet array.

The digital controller, in response to an operation instruction for image display, performs a process of storing main color video data generated for input color video data, and a process of generating sub color video data for output color video data as a result of the operation. The display has a driver circuit including an amplifier circuit, a data driver, a data modulator, and an electro-optical device. The driver circuit is included in a liquid crystal display panel of the display. The digital controller has an integrated circuit which is integrated by an oxide semiconductor transistor in place of an n-channel MOS transistor.
(actual abstract) A control system for use in a network. The control system includes an input device coupled to the network to generate an input signal. The control system also includes an RGBW controller having a plurality of input channels and a plurality of output channels, and is coupled to the network. The RGBW receives the input signal at the input channels, determines if the input signal meets a predetermined condition, and generates a series of independent output signals at the plurality of output channels in response to the input signal meeting a predetermined condition. The control system also includes one or more output devices to receive one or more of the independent output signals, and to perform one or more functions in response to receiving one or more of the independent output signals.

(predicted abstract) A light distribution control device includes a light distribution control structure having a light entrance plane, a substantially spherical light control element fixed on the light entrance plane, and a concave light guide element having a substantially spherical light distribution face on which light rays originating from the light control structure travel, the light guide element for controlling the distribution of the light rays from the light control structure as a function of the direction of the light rays. A method for controlling the light distribution of a headlight is also shown.
(actual abstract) Speed of a vehicle is acquired from a speed detecting device, and then a beam switching threshold, according to the acquired speed, of an irradiation direction of a headlight is initially set. When the number of appearance (i.e. frequency of appearance) of a light source in a predetermined time detected by a light source detection means have become the beam switching threshold or more, the headlight is switched to a low beam. When a predetermined time (beam switching prohibition time Tp) has been passed after the irradiation direction of a headlight was switched to the low beam, the irradiation direction of the headlight is switched to a high beam.
